# Module 15 — Observability

## Lesson 11: OpenTelemetry Architecture

OpenTelemetry provides vendor-neutral APIs, SDKs, semantic conventions, OTLP, auto/manual instrumentation, and a Collector. It does not prescribe a single storage or visualization backend. ([OpenTelemetry][1])

# 15.11.1 Data path

```text
application
  API → SDK → processors/readers → exporter
                         │ OTLP
                         ▼
Collector receiver → processors → exporters
                         ▼
Prometheus-compatible metrics / Loki logs / Tempo traces
```

Resource attributes identify the entity producing telemetry. Instrumentation scope identifies the library producing it. Span/metric/log attributes describe an operation or measurement.

# 15.11.2 Collector pipeline

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

processors:
  memory_limiter:
    check_interval: 1s
    limit_mib: 512
  k8sattributes: {}
  batch: {}

exporters:
  otlp/tempo:
    endpoint: tempo-distributor.monitoring.svc:4317
    tls:
      ca_file: /certs/ca.crt

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter, k8sattributes, batch]
      exporters: [otlp/tempo]
```

Verify component names and stability in the exact Collector distribution. Bind receivers deliberately; recent backend defaults may listen only on localhost unless configured.

# 15.11.3 Deployment models

```text
agent/DaemonSet → node-local collection and metadata
sidecar         → strong workload isolation, high operational cost
gateway         → central processing/export, network dependency
agent + gateway → common production combination
```

Avoid a single unscaled gateway. Use load balancing, queues, backpressure controls, topology, and telemetry about the telemetry pipeline.

# 15.11.4 Lab

Validate configuration, send test OTLP data, block the exporter, and observe queue/retry behavior. Restart the Collector under load. Confirm which data is lost. Then add a filter that removes a secret-like attribute and prove it never reaches the backend.

# 15.11.5 Security boundary

Telemetry may contain identity, URLs, SQL, headers, and business data. Apply least privilege, TLS/mTLS, tenant isolation, redaction, retention, access auditing, and data-residency rules. Baggage propagates downstream and must not carry secrets.

# 15.11.6 Beginner mental model: one universal shipping language

Without OpenTelemetry, every application and monitoring vendor may use a different envelope, address format, and delivery truck. Moving to another backend can require instrumenting the application again.

OpenTelemetry separates responsibilities:

```text
API                 application/library records telemetry
SDK                 processes and exports it
semantic conventions common names and meanings
OTLP                transports it
Collector           receives, processes, and routes it
backend             stores, queries, and visualizes it
```

OpenTelemetry is not Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, or Grafana. It can deliver signals to those systems, but it is a telemetry framework and protocol—not the long-term observability database or user interface.

# 15.11.7 API, SDK, and instrumentation libraries

The API is what instrumentation calls. The SDK is the configurable implementation used by an application owner. A library should generally depend on the API so the application can choose how data is sampled and exported.

```text
framework instrumentation -> OpenTelemetry API
application                -> configures SDK/exporter/resources
platform                   -> receives OTLP in Collector
```

This separation prevents a library from silently forcing one exporter, endpoint, sampling rule, or backend on every application.

# 15.11.8 Resources, scopes, and telemetry attributes

These three locations answer different questions:

| Location | Question | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Resource | What entity produced the data? | service name/version, cluster, environment |
| Instrumentation scope | What code/library produced it? | library name and version |
| Signal attributes | What happened in this operation/measurement? | route, result, dependency |

Do not copy every attribute to every location. Define an organization telemetry contract so `service.name`, environment, version, and ownership have consistent meanings across languages and backends.

# 15.11.9 OTLP transport choices

OTLP commonly runs over gRPC or HTTP. The choice depends on supported libraries, proxies, network policy, load balancers, and operational standards.

```text
OTLP/gRPC commonly uses 4317
OTLP/HTTP commonly uses 4318
```

Ports are conventions, not security boundaries. Decide endpoint binding, DNS, TLS/mTLS, authentication, compression, timeout, retry, and maximum message size explicitly. A receiver bound to `0.0.0.0` may accept traffic on every interface available to the container.

# 15.11.10 Collector component model

A Collector configuration declares available components, then connects selected components inside signal pipelines:

```text
receiver -> processors in declared order -> exporter
```

Other component categories may include connectors and extensions. A component existing under `receivers:` does nothing until a service pipeline references it. Likewise, a health extension must be enabled under the service configuration before it serves anything.

Always check the exact distribution:

```text
core distribution       smaller supported component set
contrib distribution    broader community component set
vendor distribution     vendor-selected components/defaults
custom distribution     organization-built allowlist
```

A copied configuration can fail because the target binary simply does not contain that component.

# 15.11.11 Processor ordering is architecture

Order changes behavior. A common conceptual order is:

```text
memory protection
  -> sensitive-data filtering/transformation
  -> metadata enrichment
  -> sampling or routing policy
  -> batching
  -> export
```

There is no universal list for every pipeline. For example, a filter may need Kubernetes metadata and therefore must run after enrichment. Tail sampling has special topology/state requirements. Document why each processor is present and test order-dependent outcomes.

# 15.11.12 Agent versus gateway decision matrix

| Requirement | Agent helps | Gateway helps |
|---|---:|---:|
| Read node-local files/host metrics | Yes | No |
| Minimize workload-to-collector network distance | Yes | Sometimes |
| Centralize credentials and export policy | Limited | Yes |
| Tail sampling across services | Not by itself | Yes, with trace-aware routing |
| Isolate noisy workloads locally | Yes | Additional controls needed |
| Fan out to several backends | Possible but duplicated | Easier to govern centrally |

The common agent-plus-gateway pattern introduces two separate queues and failure domains. Observe and test both hops.

# 15.11.13 Real hands-on: local receive-process-export lab

Save a reviewed configuration like this for a Collector distribution that contains the used components:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

processors:
  memory_limiter:
    check_interval: 1s
    limit_mib: 256
    spike_limit_mib: 64
  attributes/safety:
    actions:
      - key: http.request.header.authorization
        action: delete
  batch:
    timeout: 2s
    send_batch_size: 512

exporters:
  debug:
    verbosity: basic

extensions:
  health_check:
    endpoint: 0.0.0.0:13133

service:
  extensions: [health_check]
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter, attributes/safety, batch]
      exporters: [debug]
```

Use only synthetic data. A debug exporter can disclose telemetry content in Collector logs.

# 15.11.14 Validate one stage at a time

Use this evidence sequence:

```text
1. Collector configuration parses and starts.
2. Health endpoint responds.
3. Receiver port is listening on the intended interface.
4. A test client exports an OTLP span.
5. Receiver accepted count increases.
6. Synthetic authorization attribute is absent after processing.
7. Exporter sent count increases.
8. Graceful shutdown flushes pending batches.
```

Do not attach a real backend until the debug path works. Then replace the debug exporter with a lab backend, retest, and finally remove debug output.

# 15.11.15 Kubernetes deployment pattern

A production deployment commonly separates two roles:

```text
otel-agent DaemonSet
  - host/file receivers
  - Kubernetes resource detection
  - local batching/retry
  - exports to gateway

otel-gateway Deployment + Service
  - authenticated OTLP endpoint
  - centralized filtering/sampling/routing
  - backend credentials
  - horizontal scaling and disruption policy
```

Apply requests/limits, probes, topology spread, PodDisruptionBudget where it improves rather than blocks availability, network policies, dedicated ServiceAccounts, TLS secrets, and autoscaling based on meaningful telemetry such as accepted rate and queue pressure. CPU alone may lag behind a rapidly filling queue.

# 15.11.16 Backpressure and the retry trap

When an exporter slows:

```text
export latency rises
-> sending queue grows
-> memory/disk pressure rises
-> retries add traffic
-> data ages or is dropped
```

Retries are useful only for transient errors and only within a bounded budget. Retrying a permanent authentication or schema rejection wastes capacity. Classify errors, use exponential backoff with limits, size queues from a stated outage target, and alert before saturation.

# 15.11.17 Break it: wrong endpoint and missing component

Perform these disposable failures:

1. Send OTLP/HTTP to the gRPC port.
2. Configure an exporter name not compiled into the distribution.
3. Reference a component under `processors:` but omit it from the pipeline.
4. Point DNS to an unreachable backend.

For each, capture startup errors, receiver/exporter counters, queue behavior, and client response. Explain whether the failure occurs at configuration, connection, protocol, processing, or export time.

# 15.11.18 Break it: overload and rolling restart

Generate controlled telemetry until queue utilization becomes meaningful. Roll one gateway replica and observe load redistribution, refused records, memory limiting, retrying, and backend delivery. Then test a complete gateway outage within a safe duration.

Answer with evidence:

```text
How much data can agents buffer?
Is the queue persistent across pod restart?
How long does backlog recovery take?
Does current traffic starve backlog, or vice versa?
At what point are records dropped?
Which alert fires before loss?
```

# 15.11.19 The Collector's own observability

Monitor the telemetry pipeline as a production service. Essential categories include:

- accepted, refused, sent, failed, retried, and dropped items by signal/component;
- exporter queue capacity and utilization;
- receiver/exporter latency and errors;
- process CPU, memory, garbage collection, and restarts;
- configuration version and rollout events;
- end-to-end synthetic telemetry delay;
- backend acknowledgements and rejections.

Be cautious with metric-name examples from old tutorials; Collector internal metric names and stability can evolve. Build dashboards against the reviewed version and include an upgrade test.

# 15.11.20 Security threat model

Consider four boundaries:

```text
untrusted application -> receiver
agent -> gateway
gateway -> backend
operator -> configuration/query access
```

Controls include authenticated identities, TLS/mTLS, NetworkPolicy/firewalls, per-tenant limits, attribute allowlists, secret managers, configuration review, audit logs, retention, and least-privilege backend credentials. Do not trust inbound resource attributes such as `service.name` or tenant ID merely because a client supplied them.

Use a trusted gateway or authentication layer to derive authoritative tenant/cluster identity where required.

# 15.11.21 Schema governance and change management

Treat telemetry like a shared API:

1. Publish required resource keys and allowed values.
2. Reuse stable semantic conventions where applicable.
3. Review new high-cardinality or sensitive attributes.
4. Test dashboards and alerts against schema changes.
5. Version custom conventions and define migration windows.
6. Track missing/invalid attributes with pipeline or backend checks.

A field rename can silently break queries even though applications, collectors, and backends all remain “healthy.”

# 15.11.22 Professional troubleshooting decision tree

```text
No telemetry visible
├─ Did SDK create it?
│  ├─ no: instrumentation/provider/sampling issue
│  └─ yes
├─ Did client export successfully?
│  ├─ no: endpoint/protocol/TLS/auth/DNS issue
│  └─ yes
├─ Did Collector receiver accept it?
│  ├─ no: binding, routing, limit, decode issue
│  └─ yes
├─ Did processors drop/change it?
│  ├─ yes: filter, transform, sampling, metadata issue
│  └─ no
├─ Did exporter/backend accept it?
│  ├─ no: queue, auth, throttle, schema, tenant issue
│  └─ yes
└─ Query: time range, identity, attribute, retention, or UI issue
```

Use a synthetic known trace/log/metric and correlate the same timestamp through counters at each boundary.

# 15.11.23 Certification-oriented completion lab

This lesson covers OpenTelemetry architecture, Collector components, deployment patterns, OTLP, resources, processing, security, and debugging. Compare it with the current OpenTelemetry certification objectives before exam preparation because names and weightings can change.

Submit these artifacts:

- an architecture diagram showing trust and failure boundaries;
- a validated trace pipeline and one additional signal pipeline;
- a resource/attribute contract;
- an overload and restart report;
- a redaction proof using synthetic data;
- a dashboard/alerts for the Collector itself;
- a runbook using the troubleshooting decision tree.

# 15.11.24 Interview preparation: beginner to architect

**Beginner: Is OpenTelemetry a backend?**  No. It standardizes telemetry generation, processing, and transport; a backend stores and queries data.

**Beginner: What does a Collector receiver do?**  It accepts telemetry in a configured protocol. A processor changes or controls it, and an exporter sends it onward.

**Intermediate: Resource versus span attribute?**  A resource identifies the producing entity; a span attribute describes that operation. Service version belongs naturally on the resource, while HTTP route belongs on the span.

**Intermediate: Why is declaring a component not enough?**  It must also be referenced in a service pipeline or extensions list to participate.

**Senior: Agent or gateway?**  Choose from collection locality, metadata, policy, sampling, credentials, network, and failure isolation. Many systems use both with explicit queues and capacity.

**Senior: Why can a healthy Collector still lose data?**  Process health does not prove queue capacity, backend acceptance, checkpoint durability, sampling/filter policy, or end-to-end delivery. Observe signal counts and a canary.

**Expert: How do you scale tail sampling?**  Route all spans of a trace consistently to a decision maker, size memory for concurrent traces and decision wait, define late-span/overload behavior, and monitor sampling outcomes.

**Architect: How do you prevent telemetry spoofing?**  Authenticate senders, derive authoritative identity at trusted boundaries, reject or overwrite untrusted resource/tenant fields, isolate networks and tenants, and audit policy changes.

**Never-forget answer:** OpenTelemetry decouples instrumentation from storage. The Collector is programmable data infrastructure, so component order, identity, queues, and failure behavior must be designed and tested.
