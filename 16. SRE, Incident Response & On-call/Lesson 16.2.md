# Module 16 — SRE, Incident Response & On-call

## Lesson 2: SLIs, SLOs, SLAs and Error Budgets

# 16.2.1 Definitions

```text
SLI = measured behavior users care about
SLO = target for that behavior over a window
SLA = agreement with explicit consequences
error budget = allowed unreliability implied by the SLO
```

Google's SRE guidance recommends starting with user needs rather than whatever metric is easiest to collect. A 100% target is usually undesirable because it hides the economic and engineering tradeoff. ([Google SRE][1])

# 16.2.2 Event-based SLI

For valid eligible requests:

```text
availability SLI = good events / valid events
SLO              = 99.9% over rolling 30 days
error budget     = 0.1% of valid events
```

Define good, valid, excluded, data source, aggregation, window, missing-data behavior, late data, owner, and review cadence. Do not exclude failures merely because they are inconvenient.

# 16.2.3 Time-based budget

For a 30-day window:

```text
99%     → 432 minutes
99.9%   → 43.2 minutes
99.95%  → 21.6 minutes
99.99%  → 4.32 minutes
```

Request-based services should normally use event ratios because traffic is not uniform. Time approximations are useful for intuition.

# 16.2.4 Multi-window burn alerts

Burn rate compares observed bad-event rate with allowed bad-event rate.

```promql
bad_ratio / (1 - slo_target)
```

Use paired short and long windows: a fast page for severe consumption, slower notification for gradual burn. Require traffic or enough events to avoid meaningless ratios.

# 16.2.5 Error-budget policy

Define what happens when budget is healthy, at risk, and exhausted. Actions can include rollout tightening, reliability work, dependency review, or feature freeze. The policy must be agreed before conflict.

# 16.2.6 Lab

Write an SLO for checkout availability and p95 latency. Implement recording rules, burn alerts, and a dashboard. Replay low traffic, high error burst, slow burn, and missing data. Prove the alert behavior matches policy.

# 16.2.7 Interview answer

> **An SLI is the measured user behavior, an SLO is its target over a defined window, and an SLA adds explicit consequences. The error budget makes the reliability-versus-change tradeoff visible. I specify valid and good events, exclusions, data source, missing-data semantics, and use multi-window burn alerts tied to a pre-agreed policy.**

# 16.2.8 Beginner analogy: promise, measurement, and consequence

For a train service:

```text
SLI  = percentage of trains arriving within 5 minutes
SLO  = at least 99% over a calendar month
SLA  = customer contract provides a refund below an agreed level
budget = 1% may arrive outside the objective before SLO is missed
```

The SLI is not “number of running servers.” It measures what the passenger experiences. The same thinking applies to software.

# 16.2.9 Choose a critical user journey

Work from a verb and outcome:

```text
user can sign in
customer can submit an order
worker processes an eligible message on time
report is complete by 06:00
stored object can be retrieved without corruption
```

Do not begin with a convenient CPU graph. For each journey, ask what good means, what counts as a valid opportunity, where evidence is observed, and what risk the business accepts.

# 16.2.10 Availability, latency, freshness, correctness, durability

Example SLI specifications:

```text
availability = successful eligible requests / eligible requests
latency      = eligible requests below threshold / eligible requests
freshness    = records updated within threshold / eligible records
correctness  = verified correct outcomes / sampled or total outcomes
durability   = retrievable intact objects / objects promised durable
```

P95 is a descriptive percentile, not by itself a complete SLI contract. A threshold-based good-event ratio often maps more directly to “99% of requests finish within 300 ms.”

# 16.2.11 Write a complete SLI specification

```yaml
name: todo-create-availability
journey: create a todo
good_event: HTTP 201 after authoritative persistence
valid_event: syntactically valid POST /todos reaching the service
excluded:
  - explicitly identified synthetic maintenance test
source: server request counter reconciled with edge telemetry
grouping: production, global
window: rolling 30d
missing_data: bad after a defined telemetry grace period
late_data: recompute within 2h; record correction
owner: team-todo
review: quarterly or after contract change
```

Every exclusion is a potential loophole. Document and monitor excluded volume.

# 16.2.12 Client-side versus server-side measurement

Server metrics are easy to own but may miss DNS, load balancer, network, or requests that never reached the service. Edge/client/synthetic measures are closer to the user but may lack application context.

Use the most representative trustworthy source and understand its blind spots. For critical journeys, compare two independent views and alert if measurement coverage drops.

# 16.2.13 Calculate an event budget

For a 99.9% availability objective and 12,000,000 valid requests in the window:

```text
allowed bad fraction = 1 - 0.999 = 0.001
allowed bad events   = 12,000,000 × 0.001 = 12,000
```

If 9,000 have already failed:

```text
budget consumed = 9,000 / 12,000 = 75%
budget remaining = 25%
```

The final event count is unknown early in a rolling window, so systems often express consumption using error ratio and burn rate rather than a fixed request total.

# 16.2.14 Burn rate in plain language

At a 99.9% SLO, the allowed bad ratio is 0.1%. If current bad ratio is 1%:

```text
burn rate = 1% / 0.1% = 10
```

The service is consuming budget ten times as fast as permitted. At sustained 10× burn, a 30-day budget would be spent in roughly three days. Burn rate connects incident severity to the objective rather than an arbitrary raw error threshold.

# 16.2.15 PromQL building blocks

Assume bounded counters:

```promql
# Valid request rate.
sum(rate(http_server_requests_total{service="checkout",eligible="true"}[5m]))

# Bad request rate.
sum(rate(http_server_requests_total{
  service="checkout",eligible="true",slo_result="bad"
}[5m]))

# Bad ratio with traffic checked separately.
(
  sum(rate(http_server_requests_total{service="checkout",eligible="true",slo_result="bad"}[5m]))
/
  sum(rate(http_server_requests_total{service="checkout",eligible="true"}[5m]))
)
```

Recording rules make shared definitions reviewable. Test zero traffic, missing series, counter resets, partial target loss, and label mismatches.

# 16.2.16 Multi-window, multi-burn alerts

Pair a long window that confirms meaningful budget consumption with a short window that confirms the condition is current:

```text
fast page: severe burn over short + medium windows
slow ticket/page by policy: moderate burn over longer windows
```

Thresholds should be derived from SLO window, acceptable budget fraction, and desired detection time. Do not memorize a blog's constants without understanding the derivation and traffic model.

# 16.2.17 Missing and low traffic

If the denominator is zero, the ratio is undefined—not automatically perfect. Define whether to:

```text
show “no data”
use a synthetic probe for continuous availability evidence
require a minimum event count before a burn alert
open a coverage alert when telemetry is unexpectedly absent
evaluate batch/freshness outcomes instead of request ratios
```

Low-volume services may need longer windows or event-count logic to avoid one failure producing a noisy ratio while still preserving real impact.

# 16.2.18 Composite journeys and dependencies

Do not average unrelated SLIs into a number that hides harm. For a checkout journey, measure its end-to-end result at an authoritative boundary. Dependency SLIs are diagnostic or contractual inputs, but the customer objective remains the product journey.

When regional behavior differs, keep a global objective plus scoped views. A global average can hide a total outage in a small region.

# 16.2.19 Error-budget policy example

```text
Healthy (>50% budget remaining)
  normal delivery; planned reliability work continues

At risk (10–50%)
  review top causes; tighten high-risk changes; fund remediation

Exhausted (<10% or projected miss)
  pause discretionary risky releases; exceptions require accountable approval;
  prioritize restoration/prevention until burn is controlled

Measurement invalid
  repair coverage; use approved fallback; do not claim compliance
```

Exceptions must name business reason, risk, duration, approver, and compensating controls. The budget is a decision mechanism, not a punishment score.

# 16.2.20 Real hands-on SLO workshop

For `checkout-api`:

1. Interview a product owner about valuable outcomes and acceptable failure.
2. Write availability and latency SLI specifications.
3. Instrument good/valid counters or derive trusted edge events.
4. Add recording rules for rates, ratios, and burn.
5. Build compliance/budget/dashboard views.
6. Add fast/slow alerts tied to policy.
7. Run synthetic traffic for success, high burst, slow burn, low traffic, and missing telemetry.
8. Record whether each scenario pages, tickets, or shows no data.

# 16.2.21 Failure exercise: dishonest exclusions

Exclude all dependency timeouts and observe the SLI improve while users still fail. Restore a definition based on user eligibility/outcome and classify the dependency only for diagnosis.

Then remove one scrape target. Determine whether the aggregate looks falsely healthy. Add coverage monitoring or a more trustworthy measurement boundary.

# 16.2.22 SLO review checklist

- Critical user and journey are named.
- Good and valid events are unambiguous.
- Threshold and window reflect business risk.
- Exclusions are justified, bounded, and observed.
- Source covers real failures and has known blind spots.
- Missing, late, duplicated, and low-volume data have semantics.
- Recording rules and alerts have tests.
- Dashboard shows traffic, compliance, burn, and coverage.
- Error-budget actions and exception authority are pre-agreed.
- Target is reviewed after material product or dependency change.

# 16.2.23 Certification and interview preparation

SLI/SLO/error-budget concepts appear across SRE and cloud reliability learning. No tutorial can guarantee a specific exam version; compare against official current objectives.

**Beginner: SLI versus SLO?**  The SLI is a measured behavior; the SLO is its target over a defined window.

**Beginner: SLO versus SLA?**  An SLA is an external/formal agreement with explicit consequences; an internal SLO is an engineering objective and is often stricter.

**Intermediate: Why avoid 100%?**  It removes the risk budget, may be impossible given dependencies, and can force disproportionate cost/change resistance unless the requirement truly demands it.

**Intermediate: Why request-based rather than time-based availability?**  Traffic varies; event ratios weight actual user opportunities instead of treating quiet and busy minutes equally.

**Senior: What is burn rate?**  Observed bad-event fraction divided by the allowed bad fraction. It states how fast the error budget is being consumed.

**Senior: How do you handle no traffic?**  Treat the ratio as undefined, display traffic, use minimum events or appropriate windows, and use synthetic/freshness objectives when continuous evidence is required.

**Expert: Can a team change SLI exclusions after an incident?**  Correct a genuinely invalid specification through reviewed governance and preserve historical interpretation. Do not retroactively hide inconvenient failures.

**Architect: How do SLOs affect delivery?**  A pre-agreed error-budget policy adjusts release risk and reliability investment while preserving accountable exceptions for business needs.

**Never-forget answer:** a useful SLO measures a precise user outcome, declares uncertainty and exclusions, and drives an agreed decision when the budget burns.

- Hands-on build: Produce an incident timeline, change ledger, and status update and link it to this practice case ID.
- Safe execution rule: use synthetic data, explicit placeholders, a disposable target, least privilege, and a written abort condition.
- Read-only first check: capture current version, configuration, health, recent changes, workload scope, and the exact user signal.
- Failure injection: remove one node, zone, or recovery dependency.
