# Module 18 — Platform Engineering

## Lesson 4: Golden Paths and Software Templates

# 18.4.1 Golden-path contract

A golden path packages:

```text
repository structure and ownership
runtime and dependency policy
tests and CI workflow
artifact build/sign/scan
deployment configuration
identity and secrets pattern
metrics/logs/traces/SLO starter
runbooks and documentation
cost/allocation metadata
upgrade lifecycle
```

Defaults should be secure and operable, but exposed parameters must remain understandable.

# 18.4.2 Backstage template

```yaml
apiVersion: scaffolder.backstage.io/v1beta3
kind: Template
metadata:
  name: production-api
  title: Production API
spec:
  owner: group:default/platform
  type: service
  parameters:
    - title: Service identity
      required: [name, owner, tier]
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
          pattern: '^[a-z][a-z0-9-]+$'
        owner:
          type: string
        tier:
          type: string
          enum: [1, 2, 3]
  steps:
    - id: fetch
      name: Render skeleton
      action: fetch:template
      input:
        url: ./skeleton
        values:
          name: '${{ parameters.name }}'
```

Template action identifiers and syntax depend on the installed Backstage release. Review actions because they can write repositories, cloud resources, and credentials. ([Backstage][1])

# 18.4.3 Template lifecycle

Version templates and generated assets. Prefer centrally reusable actions/workflows over copying complex logic into every repository. Provide migrations or automated update pull requests for existing services; creating new services alone does not maintain the fleet.

# 18.4.4 Test strategy

```text
schema and parameter validation
snapshot/render tests
policy/security tests
generated project build/test
ephemeral infrastructure test
upgrade test from prior template version
negative authorization tests
```

# 18.4.5 Lab

Create a service template that generates application code, Dockerfile, CI, Kubernetes base/overlays, catalog entity, ownership, observability, and runbook. Instantiate it twice, upgrade the template, and prove how existing services receive the improvement.

# 18.4.6 Beginner mental model: a maintained building blueprint

A blueprint helps many teams start with safe plumbing and exits, but a copied blueprint does not upgrade buildings already constructed. A software template accelerates creation; a golden path also covers ongoing upgrades, operations, support, and decommission.

# 18.4.7 Golden-path contract

Define:

```text
target personas and supported use cases
inputs, defaults, validations, and outputs
generated ownership/docs/telemetry/security
supported languages/runtime versions
SLO and support channel
upgrade and migration mechanism
extension/exception boundaries
deprecation lifecycle
```

Make the common safe choice easiest, and expose advanced complexity only when needed.

# 18.4.8 Template inputs

Use meaningful intent:

```yaml
serviceName: todo-api
owner: team-todo
tier: 1
runtime: python-web
dataClassification: confidential
environments: [dev, production]
databaseClass: postgres-standard
```

Validate names, team identity, allowed combinations, quota, and authorization server-side. Never accept arbitrary repository/cloud role/namespace values and trust the UI alone.

# 18.4.9 Template outputs

A production-ready service template can create:

```text
repository with build/test/dependency baseline
catalog entity and docs
reusable CI workflow reference
container/IaC/Kubernetes source
GitOps application/environment config
ownership/security/cost metadata
metrics/log/trace instrumentation starter
SLO/dashboard/alert/runbook skeleton
renovation/upgrade configuration
```

Avoid generated secrets and direct broad cloud credentials.

# 18.4.10 Workflow transaction and partial failure

Creating a repository, database request, catalog entry, and GitOps config spans systems without one transaction. Track a workflow ID and explicit state:

```text
VALIDATED -> REPO_CREATED -> CONFIG_PR_CREATED
-> CATALOG_REGISTERED -> READY
or PARTIAL_FAILURE -> RETRY/COMPENSATE/MANUAL_REPAIR
```

Actions must be idempotent. Record created resources and safe cleanup/ownership; do not silently leave orphan infrastructure.

# 18.4.11 Template security

Threat-model:

```text
malicious template or action code
server-side template injection
untrusted URL/repository fetch
workflow identity privilege
secret leakage in logs/output
repository ownership/branch protection bypass
arbitrary cloud resource or namespace creation
supply-chain dependency in generated code
```

Allowlist actions/integrations, review templates, isolate execution, use short-lived scoped identities, validate inputs, audit results, and pin dependencies where appropriate.

# 18.4.12 Day-2 upgrade problem

Copied files drift immediately. Use combinations of:

```text
reusable CI workflows/actions referenced centrally
shared libraries/base images/charts with versioning
dependency update automation
codemods/renovation pull requests
scorecards for supported versions
compatibility and migration guides
```

Do not overwrite application-owned changes blindly.

# 18.4.13 Template versioning

Track template version in generated metadata. Use semantic or documented version policy, release notes, compatibility matrix, migration tooling, support windows, and consumer inventory.

Test old generated services against new platform capability versions. The template repository passing its own test is insufficient.

# 18.4.14 Real hands-on: production service template

Build a Backstage software template or equivalent workflow that:

1. Requests service name, owner, tier, runtime, data class.
2. Validates owner and permissions.
3. Creates a repository from a versioned skeleton.
4. Registers catalog/TechDocs.
5. Adds reusable CI and GitOps configuration through PR.
6. Adds telemetry/SLO/runbook starters.
7. Emits workflow status and ownership.
8. Uses synthetic/no credentials in generated files.

Pin a reviewed Backstage/action version and follow current template schema.

# 18.4.15 Test pyramid

```text
unit: parameters, filters, rendering helpers
snapshot/golden: expected generated tree (review change intentionally)
schema/policy: YAML, pipeline, catalog, manifests, secrets
integration: fake/isolated SCM/catalog/GitOps APIs and partial failure
end-to-end: create service -> build -> deploy lab -> observe -> delete
upgrade: old generated service -> supported new version
security: unauthorized input/action/secret/SSRF attempts
```

# 18.4.16 Failure lab: retry after partial creation

Fail after repository creation but before catalog registration. Retry the same workflow ID. It should detect the owned existing repository, continue safely or request explicit repair, and never create `todo-api-2` silently.

Test cleanup only against exact workflow-owned synthetic resources.

# 18.4.17 Failure lab: unsupported fork

Let a team modify generated CI locally. Release a central security fix. Compare a copied workflow with a centrally referenced version/renovation PR. Define what remains team-owned, what platform can update, and how exceptions expire.

# 18.4.18 Adoption and documentation

Provide a ten-minute quick start, conceptual contract, input/output reference, local testing, troubleshooting, support/SLO, extension, exception, migration, and deletion docs. Measure completion time, abandonment step, failures, post-creation readiness, upgrade adoption, and support tickets.

# 18.4.19 Review checklist

- Solves a researched common journey.
- Intent-based inputs are validated and authorized.
- Generated outputs meet production readiness.
- Workflow is idempotent and exposes partial state.
- Identity is short-lived/least privilege; secrets never generated/logged.
- Templates/actions/dependencies are reviewed and controlled.
- Existing consumers have upgrade/migration path.
- Extension, exception, support, and deletion are documented.
- End-to-end and failure tests run with isolated resources.
- Outcome/adoption/maintenance metrics have owners.

# 18.4.20 Certification and interview preparation

Golden paths and templates are core platform product/interface topics. Verify current template APIs and current certification syllabus.

**Beginner: Template versus golden path?**  A template creates initial artifacts; a golden path includes the supported lifecycle, integrations, operations, upgrades, and help.

**Intermediate: What should a service template generate?**  Only what supports the promised journey: code/build, ownership/docs, delivery/runtime intent, security/telemetry/readiness, with no secrets.

**Intermediate: Why idempotency?**  Multi-system workflows fail partially and users retry; repeating must not create conflicting duplicate resources.

**Senior: How do you upgrade generated services?**  Central reusable components, version metadata, dependency automation/codemods, compatibility tests, migration PRs, support windows, and scorecards.

**Senior: What is the biggest template security risk?**  Privileged workflow execution over untrusted inputs/actions/URLs; constrain sources, validate, isolate, least privilege, and audit.

**Expert: How do you handle legitimate customization?**  Define supported extension points and ownership, protect platform-managed contracts, and use reviewed time-bounded exceptions/migration.

**Architect: How do you know the golden path works?**  Task completion/lead time, production readiness, reliability/security guardrails, upgrade compliance, support/toil, adoption/retention, and qualitative user evidence.

**Never-forget answer:** scaffolding is day zero. The platform must own the safe contract, partial failure, upgrades, support, and eventual decommission.

# 18.4.21 Professional Mastery Workbook

This workbook expands **Golden Paths and Software Templates** into deliberate practice without replacing the authored tutorial above.

Use it after reading the core explanation. The goal is not to memorize thousands of lines; the goal is to repeatedly explain, build, break, secure, observe, recover, and defend the lesson in different conditions.

## Workbook learning contract

- Concepts covered: 20 lesson-specific anchors.
- Progression: beginner, intermediate, expert, professional, industry-ready, certification review, and interview defense.
- Safety: use synthetic data, disposable resources, explicit placeholders, least privilege, and bounded failure experiments.
- Completion: retain commands or configuration, observations, screenshots or query output, decisions, rollback evidence, and a short reflection.
- Quality rule: a passing answer states assumptions, protects a user or business outcome, names ownership, and validates the final result end to end.
- Currency rule: verify current official documentation, versions, limits, pricing, and certification objectives before relying on changing product behavior.

## Seven-stage progression

| Stage | Learner must demonstrate |
|---|---|
| Beginner | Explain the concept in plain language and give one safe example. |
| Intermediate | Connect components, data, control flow, and normal operating behavior. |
| Expert | Analyze trade-offs, edge cases, scaling pressure, and correlated failures. |
| Professional | Make a reviewed decision with owner, evidence, rollout, and rollback. |
| Industry-ready | Operate the design under security, failure, recovery, cost, and compliance constraints. |
| Certification review | Map durable concepts to the latest official objectives without relying on stale wording. |
| Interview defense | Answer concisely, clarify assumptions, draw the model, and defend alternatives. |
