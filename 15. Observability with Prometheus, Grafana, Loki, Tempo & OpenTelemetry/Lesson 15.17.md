# Module 15 — Observability

## Lesson 17: Observability for CI/CD and Argo CD

# 15.17.1 Delivery telemetry

Measure the delivery system as a user journey:

```text
commit → checks → artifact → config promotion
→ Argo detects revision → sync → healthy → customer validation
```

Useful dimensions include repository, workflow, environment, service, result, and controlled failure category. Avoid commit SHA as a long-lived Prometheus label; preserve it in logs, traces, annotations, or exemplars.

# 15.17.2 Delivery indicators

```text
change lead time
deployment frequency
change failure rate
time to restore
queue duration
build/test duration
artifact publish failures
commit-to-Synced-and-Healthy
rollout promotion/abort duration
```

Definitions must be versioned. A deployment event is not necessarily a successful customer release.

# 15.17.3 Argo CD and Rollouts

Scrape Argo CD controller, API server, repo-server, ApplicationSet, notifications, and other enabled component endpoints. Monitor Application sync/health, cluster connection/cache, reconciliation, render errors/resources, sync results, and notification failures. For Rollouts, observe phase, pause, AnalysisRuns, stable/canary traffic, and abort behavior.

# 15.17.4 Deployment correlation

Write release metadata to a durable event stream or deployment marker:

```json
{
  "service":"todo-api",
  "environment":"production",
  "image_digest":"sha256:...",
  "config_revision":"abc123",
  "started_at":"2026-08-15T12:00:00Z",
  "result":"healthy",
  "change_url":"https://git.example/pull/42"
}
```

Grafana annotations should link the version and change, not become the only audit record.

# 15.17.5 Lab

Create a dashboard from commit to healthy. Release a controlled bad image that fails readiness and verify:

```text
pipeline build remains successful if artifact is valid
Git promotion is visible
Argo sync/health shows the failure
customer SLI remains protected by rollout strategy
alert routes to the service owner
rollback/revert markers appear
```

# 15.17.6 Interview answer

> **I model delivery as an observable distributed system. I correlate immutable artifact digest, config revision, Argo operation, rollout analysis, and customer SLIs. I distinguish build success, sync, health, progressive promotion, and customer outcome, then measure lead time, deployment frequency, change failure rate, and restoration time with stable definitions.**

# 15.17.7 Beginner mental model: delivery is another production service

A deployment is not a single event. It is a journey with queues, dependencies, retries, state transitions, and users:

```text
developer -> source review -> CI -> artifact registry -> config Git
          -> Argo CD reconciliation -> rollout -> runtime validation
```

The “user” of CI/CD is both the engineer waiting for safe feedback and the customer receiving the change. Observe the delivery system with the same discipline as an API.

# 15.17.8 Define release states precisely

These states are not interchangeable:

| State | What it proves | What it does not prove |
|---|---|---|
| Build passed | configured checks succeeded | deployable in every environment |
| Artifact published | immutable artifact exists | config points to it |
| Git promoted | desired state changed | cluster reconciled it |
| Synced | live resources match desired revision | workload serves correctly |
| Healthy | Argo health assessment passes | customer SLI is healthy |
| Rollout promoted | rollout policy completed | no latent regression |

Choose the exact terminal event for each delivery metric. Lead time ending at Git merge tells a different story from lead time ending at customer validation.

# 15.17.9 Stable delivery event schema

Record immutable identifiers in an event/log store:

```json
{
  "event": "deployment_completed",
  "service": "todo-api",
  "environment": "production",
  "artifact_digest": "sha256:synthetic",
  "config_revision": "synthetic-git-revision",
  "application": "todo-api-prod",
  "rollout_id": "synthetic-rollout",
  "started_at": "2026-08-15T12:00:00Z",
  "completed_at": "2026-08-15T12:04:30Z",
  "result": "healthy",
  "failure_category": null
}
```

Use bounded dimensions for aggregate metrics. Preserve commit, digest, workflow run, and rollout identifiers in events, annotations, and links.

# 15.17.10 Delivery metrics without gaming

Define numerator, denominator, clock boundaries, excluded events, time zone, owner, and source of truth. Examples:

```text
deployment frequency
  = successful production releases per service per period

change failure rate
  = qualifying releases requiring remediation / qualifying releases

lead time
  = chosen source-change event to verified production outcome

time to restore
  = service-impact start/detection to verified SLI recovery
```

Do not rank individual developers by these system metrics. Teams will optimize the measurement instead of the delivery outcome.

# 15.17.11 Observe each dependency

For CI/CD, collect RED/queue signals around:

```text
SCM/webhooks
runner queue and execution
dependency/package download
test and security scanning
artifact registry push/pull
Git promotion automation
Argo CD repository rendering/reconciliation
Kubernetes admission/scheduling/readiness
rollout analysis and notification delivery
```

Measure provider rate limits and external availability. A long “build” may actually be a job waiting 25 minutes for a runner.

# 15.17.12 Argo CD observability model

Map components to failure questions:

```text
application-controller: reconciliation, cluster/cache, operation results
repo-server: repository access and manifest generation
API server: user/API operations and auth path
ApplicationSet controller: generation/reconciliation
notifications controller: triggers and delivery attempts
Redis/cache where deployed: shared state/cache availability
```

Scrape only metrics enabled and documented for the reviewed Argo CD version. High-cardinality application/resource metrics may need explicit enablement and allowlists. Protect metrics endpoints with network and access controls.

# 15.17.13 Argo CD health versus customer health

Argo CD health is based on resource health rules. A Deployment can be ready while the checkout SLI is failing for a particular region or dependency. Join but do not confuse:

```text
desired revision
-> sync result
-> Kubernetes readiness/health
-> rollout analysis
-> service SLI/error budget
```

Promotion automation should query a well-defined service signal, with behavior for missing/late telemetry. “No data” must not silently become “pass.”

# 15.17.14 Real hands-on: commit-to-customer dashboard

Build rows for:

1. Source/CI: queue, duration, failures, last successful artifact.
2. Promotion: config revision and approval/promotion time.
3. Argo CD: desired/synced revision, sync and health status, reconcile errors.
4. Rollout: step, replica distribution, AnalysisRun result, abort/promotion.
5. Runtime: request rate, errors, latency, saturation, SLO burn.
6. Changes: deployment annotations with digest/revision links.

The dashboard should answer “Where is this release now?” and “Did customers remain healthy?” without opening five unrelated tools.

# 15.17.15 Add an immutable deployment marker

After a verified state transition, emit a structured event from a trusted controller or workflow. Include links to the source review, CI run, artifact provenance, config revision, Argo Application, and rollback/revert procedure.

Do not let arbitrary workloads claim a production deployment identity. Generate or verify the marker at a trusted delivery boundary.

# 15.17.16 Failure lab: artifact good, deployment bad

Build a syntactically valid image whose health endpoint fails because of a controlled configuration expectation. Expected evidence:

```text
CI build and artifact publication succeed
config promotion references immutable digest
Argo detects and applies desired revision
Kubernetes readiness fails
Argo health degrades
rollout does not shift unsafe traffic
service SLI remains protected where strategy allows
owner receives actionable notification
Git revert or rollout abort restores known-good state
```

This teaches why “pipeline green” is not “release successful.”

# 15.17.17 Failure lab: observability is missing during promotion

Make the analysis query return no data. Decide and test the safe policy:

```text
fail/abort promotion
pause for human review
retry within a bounded window
use an explicitly approved fallback signal
```

Never quietly interpret missing metrics as zero errors. Monitor analysis execution and query errors separately from the evaluated business value.

# 15.17.18 Failure lab: Argo reconciliation delay

Create repository access failure or a safe reconciliation delay in a lab. Distinguish:

```text
Git desired state changed
Argo has not observed it
manifest generation failed
sync operation failed
resources synced but unhealthy
customer outcome failed
```

Measure commit-to-detected, detected-to-sync, sync-to-ready, and ready-to-validated time. One combined duration hides the responsible boundary.

# 15.17.19 Alerting and ownership

Examples of actionable conditions:

- sustained production Application out-of-sync beyond approved reconciliation window;
- sync/manifest generation error for a critical service;
- rollout paused/aborted with customer risk;
- controller/repo-server errors or queue delay threatening delivery objective;
- production artifact/config revision cannot be determined;
- notification/analysis pipeline failure;
- customer SLO burn following a recent release.

Route by service/platform ownership. Include application, environment, revision/digest, state, duration, dashboard, and runbook. Avoid paging on routine short reconciliation.

# 15.17.20 Security and supply-chain correlation

Link, without exposing secrets:

```text
source review and approver
CI identity and workflow revision
SBOM/scan/provenance location
signed immutable artifact digest
Git config change and authorization
Argo service account/project boundary
cluster admission result
runtime service version
```

Observability data is evidence, not the enforcement mechanism. Use signed artifacts, protected branches/environments, least privilege, admission policy, and audited GitOps changes; expose their outcomes in the delivery timeline.

# 15.17.21 Production release runbook

```text
1. Confirm immutable artifact and config revision.
2. Observe Argo detected/sync/health state.
3. Observe rollout step and analysis result.
4. Compare service SLI, dependencies, and saturation with baseline.
5. Correlate errors/traces/logs to new service version.
6. Promote only after the defined observation window.
7. On failure, abort/revert authoritative desired state.
8. Verify old/new replicas, traffic, SLI, and Git/Argo convergence.
9. Record release outcome and remediation timestamps.
```

# 15.17.22 Certification and interview preparation

This lesson connects observability with GitOps, Kubernetes delivery, progressive rollout, and engineering-performance concepts. Consult current official Argo CD/Rollouts and certification objectives for version-specific metric names.

**Beginner: What is deployment observability?**  The ability to follow a change from source through build, artifact, desired state, reconciliation, rollout, and customer outcome.

**Intermediate: Synced versus healthy?**  Synced means live resources match desired manifests; health describes the resource state according to health assessment. Neither alone proves customer success.

**Intermediate: Why avoid commit SHA as a Prometheus label?**  Every change creates a new value/series. Keep it in deployment events, logs, annotations, or an info-style controlled mapping.

**Senior: How do you calculate change failure rate?**  Version the definitions of qualifying release and remediation, use an authoritative event model, and calculate failures divided by qualifying releases over the chosen period.

**Senior: What should progressive delivery do when its metric query has no data?**  Follow an explicit safe policy—normally pause, retry, or abort based on risk. Never silently treat missing evidence as success.

**Expert: How do you correlate an incident to a deployment?**  Compare SLI onset with immutable digest/config revision/service version markers, then verify affected traces/logs carry that version and test rollback recovery.

**Architect: How do you stop delivery metrics from becoming harmful targets?**  Use them to improve systems, publish stable definitions and uncertainty, combine quantitative and qualitative review, and avoid individual ranking or target gaming.

**Never-forget answer:** delivery is a distributed system. Observe every state transition and immutable identity, but judge success using the customer signal.

# 15.17.23 Professional Mastery Workbook

This workbook expands **Observability for CI/CD and Argo CD** into deliberate practice without replacing the authored tutorial above.

Use it after reading the core explanation. The goal is not to memorize thousands of lines; the goal is to repeatedly explain, build, break, secure, observe, recover, and defend the lesson in different conditions.

## Workbook learning contract

- Concepts covered: 22 lesson-specific anchors.
- Progression: beginner, intermediate, expert, professional, industry-ready, certification review, and interview defense.
- Safety: use synthetic data, disposable resources, explicit placeholders, least privilege, and bounded failure experiments.
- Completion: retain commands or configuration, observations, screenshots or query output, decisions, rollback evidence, and a short reflection.
- Quality rule: a passing answer states assumptions, protects a user or business outcome, names ownership, and validates the final result end to end.
- Currency rule: verify current official documentation, versions, limits, pricing, and certification objectives before relying on changing product behavior.

## Seven-stage progression

| Stage | Learner must demonstrate |
|---|---|

- Objective: Preserve a measurable user or business outcome while making the governance decision explicit.
- Assumptions to write first: traffic or work volume, data sensitivity, ownership, environment, failure domain, and acceptable risk.
- Diagram task: Mark actors, source of truth, synchronous and asynchronous paths, identity, data, control plane, and recovery boundary.
- Hands-on build: Produce a metrics-to-trace-to-log correlation record and link it to this practice case ID.
- Safe execution rule: use synthetic data, explicit placeholders, a disposable target, least privilege, and a written abort condition.
- Read-only first check: capture current version, configuration, health, recent changes, workload scope, and the exact user signal.
- Failure injection: remove trace-context propagation at one boundary.
- Expected observation: predict one user signal, one component signal, and one control-plane or change signal before running the test.
- Troubleshooting branch: write two competing hypotheses and the cheapest safe check that distinguishes them.
- Security check: test unauthorized access, unsafe input, secret exposure, excessive privilege, and audit evidence where relevant.
- Reliability check: test timeout, retry, partial success, duplicate work, degraded mode, and recovery within the stated objective.

- Certification checkpoint: Map the result to the current Prometheus or OpenTelemetry objectives and state which behavior was proved.
- Interview prompt: Defend **Delivery telemetry** against an alternative while protecting governance under this scenario.
- Strong-answer outline: clarify requirements; draw the mechanism; quantify scale; cover security and failure; choose; validate; state limitation.
