# Module 15 — Observability

## Lesson 7: Grafana Dashboards as Operational Interfaces

A dashboard is a decision interface, not a wall of charts. It should answer: Are users affected? What changed? Where is the failure? Who owns it? What should I inspect next?

# 15.7.1 Dashboard hierarchy

```text
fleet overview
  → service overview
    → dependency/resource detail
      → logs and traces
```

Begin a service dashboard with traffic, success, latency distributions, saturation, deployments, and SLO status. Add links to runbooks, repository, ownership, logs, and traces.

# 15.7.2 Variables and transformations

Use bounded variables such as environment, cluster, namespace, and service. Default to a meaningful production scope. Avoid `All` when it can issue an enormous query. Transform data only when the transformation remains auditable; important business logic belongs in recording rules.

Provision dashboards and data sources from Git:

```yaml
apiVersion: 1
providers:
  - name: platform
    folder: Platform
    type: file
    options:
      path: /var/lib/grafana/dashboards/platform
```

# 15.7.3 Visual correctness

```text
time series → trends and deploy correlation
stat        → one current objective/status
table       → ranked instances or owners
heatmap     → latency distribution
state timeline → phase/availability transitions
```

Show units, thresholds, query window, and null behavior. A green panel based on absent data is dangerous. Display deployment annotations and dashboard freshness.

# 15.7.4 Lab — service dashboard

Create:

1. Request rate.
2. Error ratio.
3. p50/p95/p99 latency.
4. SLO/error-budget panel.
5. CPU and memory request/usage.
6. Replica availability and restarts.
7. Dependency latency/errors.
8. Links from a trace exemplar to Tempo and from trace ID to Loki.

Test empty data, a partial scrape outage, a new label value, and a slow query. Export the dashboard JSON and review it in Git.

# 15.7.5 Security and operations

Use SSO, least-privilege folders/teams, protected data-source credentials, audit logs, and separate edit/view roles. Back up provisioning configuration and database state. Monitor query latency, datasource errors, plugins, and authentication failures.

# Beginner Level

# 15.7.6 Grafana in layman language

Prometheus contains numbers and queries. Loki contains logs. Tempo contains traces.

Grafana is the control-room interface that helps people explore and connect those data sources.

```text
Prometheus ─┐
Loki ──────┼─► Grafana ─► dashboard/explore/alert context
Tempo ─────┘
```

A dashboard is not decoration. It should help a person make a decision.

Bad dashboard question:

```text
How many colorful charts can we display?
```

Good dashboard questions:

```text
Are users affected?
When did it start?
Which service, region or version is involved?
What changed?
Where should I investigate next?
Who owns the response?
```

---

# 15.7.7 Dashboard building blocks

```text
data source  system Grafana queries
panel        one visualization/query area
dashboard    collection of panels for one purpose
variable     user-selected reusable filter
annotation   event marker such as deployment
data link    navigation to related dashboard/log/trace
folder       organization and permission boundary
```

Grafana does not improve incorrect PromQL. Validate important queries in their native data source first.

---

# 15.7.8 Choose the correct visualization

```text
time series    trend across time
stat           one current value/objective
gauge          current position against meaningful bounds
table          ranked/listed entities and owners
heatmap        distribution such as latency buckets
state timeline phase or health transitions
logs panel     event context
```

Avoid gauges for values without a useful maximum. Avoid pie charts for time-series incidents. Use the simplest view that answers the operational question.

---

# Intermediate Level

# 15.7.9 Service dashboard order

Recommended top-to-bottom flow:

```text
1. Service identity, owner, environment and links
2. SLO/error-budget/user outcome
3. Traffic, error ratio and latency
4. Deployments and configuration events
5. Dependencies
6. Saturation/resources
7. Logs and traces navigation
8. Telemetry freshness
```

Responders should see impact before causes. A CPU panel should not be the first proof of service health.

---

# 15.7.10 Variables

Useful bounded variables:

```text
environment
cluster
region
namespace
service
```

Rules:

```text
safe default scope
do not default to every production cluster
avoid unbounded label values
show current selections clearly
repeat panels only with controlled counts
test URLs/data links with variable escaping
```

A variable can hide an outage when the default points only to a healthy region. Include fleet-level overview before narrow drill-down.

---

# 15.7.11 Units, thresholds and nulls

Every panel should define:

```text
unit
legend
time window
aggregation
threshold meaning
missing-data behavior
data freshness
```

Examples:

```text
0.05 displayed as 5% when ratio unit is percent 0–1
0.25 seconds displayed as 250 ms only through correct unit conversion
no data displayed as “No data,” not green zero
```

Threshold colors do not create an SLO. They visualize an already defined objective or operational bound.

---

# Real-world Hands-on Tutorial

# 15.7.12 Run Grafana locally

Extend the Lesson 15.2 Compose file:

```yaml
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana:REPLACE_WITH_REVIEWED_VERSION
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER: training-admin
      GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD: REPLACE_WITH_LOCAL_LAB_PASSWORD
      GF_USERS_ALLOW_SIGN_UP: "false"
    volumes:
      - grafana-data:/var/lib/grafana

volumes:
  prometheus-data:
  grafana-data:
```

Use a local-only lab password, never a real password or committed production secret.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

Add Prometheus data source URL from inside Compose networking:

```text
http://prometheus:9090
```

---

# 15.7.13 Build the Order API dashboard

Create panels:

## Request rate

```promql
sum by (route) (
  rate(order_api_http_requests_total[5m])
)
```

## Error ratio

```promql
sum(rate(order_api_http_requests_total{status_class="5xx"}[5m]))
/
sum(rate(order_api_http_requests_total[5m]))
```

## p95 latency

```promql
histogram_quantile(
  0.95,
  sum by (le, route) (
    rate(order_api_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])
  )
)
```

## In-progress requests

```promql
sum by (method) (order_api_http_requests_in_progress)
```

Set correct units, legends and descriptions. Add text links for owner, repository and a `.invalid` training runbook.

---

# 15.7.14 Deployment annotations

Add deployment events through a supported annotation data source or GitOps/deployment event integration.

Desired view:

```text
latency rises at 10:02
vertical annotation: version 2.4.7 deployed at 10:01
```

Annotations support correlation; they are not the authoritative change audit. Link to Git revision or deployment record.

---

# Break, Debug and Secure

# 15.7.15 Dashboard failure exercises

1. Change a metric name so the query returns no data.
2. Set null to zero and observe false green behavior.
3. Remove environment filter and mix dev/prod series.
4. Use average latency instead of p95 and compare visibility.
5. Create an unbounded interval/variable query and inspect load.
6. Change data-source UID and verify provisioning failure.

Troubleshooting path:

```text
panel query inspector
→ exact expanded query
→ run query directly in data source
→ inspect variable values/time range
→ check data-source health/permissions
→ check underlying collection
```

---

# Expert and Professional Level

# 15.7.16 Dashboards as code

Provision data sources and dashboards from Git:

```yaml
apiVersion: 1
providers:
  - name: atlas-services
    folder: Services
    type: file
    disableDeletion: true
    allowUiUpdates: false
    options:
      path: /var/lib/grafana/dashboards/services
```

Pipeline checks:

```text
valid JSON/schema
stable data-source UIDs
forbidden secret scan
query lint/test where possible
owner and description metadata
reviewed screenshots or rendered checks
backward compatibility
```

UI experiments should be exported/reconciled to the authoritative repository.

---

# 15.7.17 Security and availability

Production controls:

```text
SSO and MFA at identity provider
least-privilege teams/folders/data sources
separate viewer/editor/admin
protected service-account tokens
private data-source networking
plugin allowlist and lifecycle
audit logs
database/config backup
HA replicas and shared supported database when required
synthetic login/query checks
```

Do not embed database, Prometheus or cloud credentials in dashboard JSON.

---

# 15.7.18 Dashboard performance

Dashboard load can become a production incident.

Control:

```text
appropriate refresh interval
bounded default time range
recording rules for repeated expensive queries
limited high-cardinality variables
panel/query count
query timeout and concurrency
cache where appropriate
```

Measure Grafana request/query latency and data-source errors. A dashboard that takes two minutes during an incident is not operationally ready.

---

# Certification and Interview Preparation

# 15.7.19 PCA focus and practice

Understand dashboard basics, query meaning, variables, units and the relationship between Grafana and Prometheus.

Practice:

```text
A Grafana panel shows no data. What is the strongest first step?

Answer:
Inspect the expanded panel query and execute it directly against
the selected data source and time range.
```

---

# 15.7.20 Interview answers and final checklist

## What makes a good production dashboard?

> **It begins with user impact and objectives, then shows RED behavior, changes, dependencies and saturation. Queries have explicit units, scope and missing-data semantics. The dashboard links owners, runbooks, logs, traces and Git/deployment evidence, loads quickly, is provisioned from Git, and is tested during failure exercises.**

## How do you avoid dashboard sprawl?

> **I define fleet, service and detail hierarchy, assign owners, reuse standard panels/recording rules, provision from version control, track usage and freshness, and deprecate duplicates. A dashboard has a decision purpose and lifecycle.**

Checklist:

```text
□ User outcome is above resource diagnostics
□ Units, legends and scope are explicit
□ No data is not shown as healthy zero
□ Variables are bounded and default safely
□ Deployment annotations link authoritative changes
□ Expensive queries use recording rules
□ Logs/traces are one-click navigable
□ Dashboard is provisioned and reviewed
□ Access, plugins and credentials are protected
□ Load and failure behavior are tested
```

Next: Loki, structured logs and LogQL.

# 15.7.21 Professional Mastery Workbook

This workbook expands **Grafana Dashboards as Operational Interfaces** into deliberate practice without replacing the authored tutorial above.

Use it after reading the core explanation. The goal is not to memorize thousands of lines; the goal is to repeatedly explain, build, break, secure, observe, recover, and defend the lesson in different conditions.

## Workbook learning contract

- Concepts covered: 20 lesson-specific anchors.
- Progression: beginner, intermediate, expert, professional, industry-ready, certification review, and interview defense.
- Safety: use synthetic data, disposable resources, explicit placeholders, least privilege, and bounded failure experiments.
- Completion: retain commands or configuration, observations, screenshots or query output, decisions, rollback evidence, and a short reflection.
- Quality rule: a passing answer states assumptions, protects a user or business outcome, names ownership, and validates the final result end to end.
- Currency rule: verify current official documentation, versions, limits, pricing, and certification objectives before relying on changing product behavior.

## Seven-stage progression

| Stage | Learner must demonstrate |
|---|---|
| Beginner | Explain the concept in plain language and give one safe example. |
| Intermediate | Connect components, data, control flow, and normal operating behavior. |
| Expert | Analyze trade-offs, edge cases, scaling pressure, and correlated failures. |
| Professional | Make a reviewed decision with owner, evidence, rollout, and rollback. |
| Industry-ready | Operate the design under security, failure, recovery, cost, and compliance constraints. |
| Certification review | Map durable concepts to the latest official objectives without relying on stale wording. |
| Interview defense | Answer concisely, clarify assumptions, draw the model, and defend alternatives. |

- Read-only first check: capture current version, configuration, health, recent changes, workload scope, and the exact user signal.
- Failure injection: delay storage or query availability.
- Expected observation: predict one user signal, one component signal, and one control-plane or change signal before running the test.
- Troubleshooting branch: write two competing hypotheses and the cheapest safe check that distinguishes them.
- Security check: test unauthorized access, unsafe input, secret exposure, excessive privilege, and audit evidence where relevant.
- Reliability check: test timeout, retry, partial success, duplicate work, degraded mode, and recovery within the stated objective.
- Performance and cost check: record demand, latency or queueing, capacity, amplification, paid resources, and one useful unit.
- Rollback or containment: identify the smallest reversible action, its authority, expected result, risk, and stop condition.
- Recovery proof: validate the original user journey, authoritative state, backlog, telemetry, desired-state convergence, and side effects.
- Evidence package: save sanitized configuration or command, query output, UTC timeline, decision, result, and unresolved risk.
- Certification checkpoint: Map the result to the current Prometheus or OpenTelemetry objectives and state which behavior was proved.
- Interview prompt: Defend **Deployment annotations** against an alternative while protecting cost efficiency under this scenario.
- Strong-answer outline: clarify requirements; draw the mechanism; quantify scale; cover security and failure; choose; validate; state limitation.
- Common mistake to avoid: naming a tool, replica count, dashboard, or discount as proof without demonstrating the end-to-end outcome.
- Completion rule: another learner can reproduce the safe test, explain the evidence, and reach the same conclusion without private coaching.

## Workbook completion review

- Practice cases generated for this lesson: 114.
- Select at least one case at every learning level and one case for every concept card.
- Complete at least one controlled failure, one security review, one recovery proof, one cost or capacity analysis, and one oral defense.
- Revisit any case where the result depended on an unstated assumption, unverified documentation, unsafe access, or a dashboard without authoritative evidence.
- The workbook is complete only when explanations remain correct in plain language and decisions remain defensible under realistic production constraints.
