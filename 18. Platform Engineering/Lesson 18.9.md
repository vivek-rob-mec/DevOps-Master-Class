# Module 18 — Platform Engineering

## Lesson 9: Security, Secrets, Policy and Governance

# 18.9.1 Security model

```text
human identity → SSO/MFA/group → platform permission
workload identity → scoped role → provider/Kubernetes permission
desired state → policy admission → reconciled resource
secret reference → external manager → runtime material
all actions → audit/detection
```

The platform is a privilege broker. Compromise can affect many repositories, clusters, and accounts, so its control plane receives tier-0-style protection.

# 18.9.2 Permission design

Use explicit permissions for catalog, template execution, environment creation, production promotion, secret binding, and administrative actions. Verify enforcement in backend plugins/APIs, not only hidden UI buttons. Backstage policies return decisions that plugins must enforce. ([Backstage][1])

# 18.9.3 Secret delivery

Store secret values in a dedicated provider. The platform manages references, access policy, rotation, and delivery through workload identity. Never return long-lived plaintext credentials in workflow logs or portal status.

# 18.9.4 Policy as code

Policy layers:

```text
template/schema validation
CI source and artifact checks
cloud/IaC policies
Kubernetes admission
GitOps project boundaries
runtime detection
```

Test allow and deny cases. Begin some new policies in audit/warn mode, measure violations, publish remediation, then enforce. Security exceptions include scope, justification, compensating control, approver, and expiry.

# 18.9.5 Threat scenarios

1. Template action exfiltrates repository token.
2. User changes catalog owner to gain deployment permission.
3. Platform controller role can assume every account admin role.
4. Secret appears in workflow output.
5. Plugin dependency is compromised.
6. Tenant creates privileged Kubernetes workload.

For each, define prevention, detection, containment, credential rotation, and recovery.

# 18.9.6 Lab

Create a threat model and negative authorization test suite for environment provisioning. Prove a developer can create approved dev resources but cannot select production account, privileged class, another team's secret, or arbitrary Terraform module.

# 18.9.7 Beginner principle: guardrails make the safe action easy

Governance should translate organizational risk into understandable platform contracts. A developer should know what is allowed, why, how to remediate, and how to request an exception. Silent denials and security tickets encourage bypasses.

# 18.9.8 Human, workload, and automation identities

```text
human: SSO + MFA -> group/role -> approved action
workload: Kubernetes/cloud workload identity -> dependency permissions
automation: CI/controller short-lived identity -> bounded repositories/resources
break-glass: time-limited emergency role -> audit/review
```

Avoid shared users, static cloud keys, and broad tokens. Automate joiner/mover/leaver and service transfer.

# 18.9.9 Authorization model

Decide:

```text
subject: user/group/workload/service
action: create/update/delete/read/approve/replay
resource: entity/environment/tenant/database/template
context: environment, data class, ownership, time, incident
decision: allow/deny/require approval
evidence: audit reason/policy version
```

Backstage permissions cover Backstage operations, not automatic authorization inside every external provider. Enforce at each actual boundary.

# 18.9.10 Least privilege through product classes

Instead of giving developers raw cloud-admin access, expose approved classes:

```text
postgres-dev-small
postgres-prod-ha
object-store-private-retained
queue-standard
```

Each class maps to reviewed provider roles, network, encryption, backup, quota, and cost defaults. Keep an advanced review route for requirements the classes cannot satisfy.

# 18.9.11 Secret lifecycle

```text
generate at authoritative secret system
-> authorize workload identity
-> deliver/mount/fetch without Git/plain logs
-> observe age/use/failure safely
-> rotate with overlap/reload semantics
-> revoke and audit
-> delete/retain under policy
-> recover keys/secret systems during DR
```

Prefer dynamic/short-lived credentials. Do not confuse base64 encoding with encryption.

# 18.9.12 Policy-as-code layers

```text
template/API validation: prevent invalid intent early
CI/IaC policy: evaluate planned artifacts/config
admission policy: enforce at cluster/resource boundary
runtime/cloud detection: find drift and behavior
scorecard: guide posture and migration
```

Use defense in depth, but avoid five inconsistent policies with unclear authority.

# 18.9.13 Policy rule contract

```yaml
id: no-public-production-database
purpose: prevent unapproved internet exposure of confidential data
scope: production database classes
decision: deny public accessibility
owner: platform-security
remediation: choose private class/network
tests: allowed-private + denied-public + unknown-field
exception: security approval, compensating controls, expiry
version: 3
```

Test input ambiguity and missing data. Fail-open/fail-closed behavior is a risk decision per control.

# 18.9.14 Exception lifecycle

An exception contains requirement, reason, owner, exact scope, residual risk, compensating controls, approver, issue, expiry, and migration plan. Notify before expiry, re-evaluate context, and prevent permanent invisible waivers.

Report exception concentration; repeated requests may mean the golden path is incomplete or a control needs redesign.

# 18.9.15 Separation of duties

High-risk production workflows may separate source approval, artifact build, policy exception, deployment promotion, secret administration, and audit review. Avoid one compromised identity controlling the entire chain.

Do not add ceremonial approvals that provide no evidence. Automate low-risk verified decisions and reserve humans for judgment.

# 18.9.16 Real hands-on: guarded database request

Create a platform request for a production database. Test:

```text
authorized owner + approved private class -> accepted
different team owner -> denied
unapproved region/data residency -> denied
public accessibility -> denied with remediation
oversized class -> quota/cost approval
exception -> scoped expiry and compensating network control
```

Verify no resource mutation occurs before authorization/policy and every decision has safe audit.

# 18.9.17 Failure lab: secret leakage

Use `DEMO_SECRET_NEVER_REAL` and attempt to expose it through template output, workflow logs, Kubernetes event, debug exporter, and portal error. Verify redaction/minimization and search all lab backends. Fix the earliest source plus defense-in-depth.

# 18.9.18 Failure lab: policy engine unavailable

For several actions, decide:

```text
high-risk production provisioning -> fail closed/queue
read-only catalog display -> may degrade
urgent incident mitigation -> audited break-glass route
low-risk preview -> defined temporary behavior
```

Test user messages, queued state, alerts, recovery, and reconciliation. One universal fail mode is rarely correct.

# 18.9.19 Failure lab: compromised platform admin

Tabletop an admin token compromise. Assess detection, session/token revocation, privilege boundaries, audit integrity, blast radius across tenants/providers, secret access, artifact/config changes, recovery, and credential rotation. Platform admins are high-impact identities and need stronger controls.

# 18.9.20 Governance metrics

Measure policy pass/deny/unknown by rule and journey, false-positive/remediation time, exceptions and expiry, secret age/rotation failure, privileged actions, identity orphans, critical unsupported versions, security incidents, and developer task success.

Do not reward teams for zero policy failures if they avoid the platform or suppress reporting.

# 18.9.21 Production checklist

- Identities are individual/workload/automation and short-lived where possible.
- Authorization applies to exact tenant/resource/action at every system.
- Product classes encode least-privilege defaults.
- Secret lifecycle includes rotation/reload/revoke/DR.
- Policies have reason, tests, remediation, owner, version, failure mode.
- Exceptions are scoped, approved, visible, expiring, and migratable.
- Separation of duties protects high-risk chain.
- Audit is tamper-resistant and privacy-aware.
- Threat tests include admin, supply chain, tenant, policy outage, deletion.
- Governance outcomes and developer friction drive improvement.

# 18.9.22 Certification and interview preparation

Identity, secrets, policy, tenancy, supply chain, and governance span cloud/Kubernetes/platform security certifications. Verify current Backstage/provider specifics.

**Beginner: What is least privilege?**  An identity has only the actions/resources/context needed for its job, for the needed duration.

**Intermediate: Why workload identity instead of static key?**  Short-lived bound credentials reduce secret distribution, rotation, and theft impact.

**Intermediate: What is policy as code?**  Versioned testable automated policy decisions integrated into delivery/provisioning/runtime boundaries.

**Senior: Fail open or closed when policy is down?**  Decide by action risk: high-impact mutation normally blocks/queues; low-risk read may degrade; emergency uses audited scoped break-glass.

**Senior: How do exceptions remain safe?**  Exact scope, owner, risk, compensating controls, approval, expiry, visibility, and migration/review.

**Expert: Backstage grants permission—is cloud access solved?**  No. Enforce trusted identity/authorization again at workflow and provider boundaries; portal permission alone is insufficient.

**Architect: How do guardrails improve developer experience?**  Intent-level classes/defaults, early clear decisions, self-service remediation, fast automated evidence, and human review only for true exceptions.

**Never-forget answer:** platform governance is an enforceable product contract—trusted identity, safe defaults, clear policy, expiring exceptions, and verified controls at every boundary.

# 18.9.23 Professional Mastery Workbook

This workbook expands **Security, Secrets, Policy and Governance** into deliberate practice without replacing the authored tutorial above.

Use it after reading the core explanation. The goal is not to memorize thousands of lines; the goal is to repeatedly explain, build, break, secure, observe, recover, and defend the lesson in different conditions.

## Workbook learning contract

- Concepts covered: 22 lesson-specific anchors.
- Progression: beginner, intermediate, expert, professional, industry-ready, certification review, and interview defense.
- Safety: use synthetic data, disposable resources, explicit placeholders, least privilege, and bounded failure experiments.
- Completion: retain commands or configuration, observations, screenshots or query output, decisions, rollback evidence, and a short reflection.
- Quality rule: a passing answer states assumptions, protects a user or business outcome, names ownership, and validates the final result end to end.
- Currency rule: verify current official documentation, versions, limits, pricing, and certification objectives before relying on changing product behavior.

## Seven-stage progression

| Stage | Learner must demonstrate |
|---|---|
| Beginner | Explain the concept in plain language and give one safe example. |
| Intermediate | Connect components, data, control flow, and normal operating behavior. |
| Expert | Analyze trade-offs, edge cases, scaling pressure, and correlated failures. |
| Professional | Make a reviewed decision with owner, evidence, rollout, and rollback. |
| Industry-ready | Operate the design under security, failure, recovery, cost, and compliance constraints. |
| Certification review | Map durable concepts to the latest official objectives without relying on stale wording. |
| Interview defense | Answer concisely, clarify assumptions, draw the model, and defend alternatives. |
