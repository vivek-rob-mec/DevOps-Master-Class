# Module 20 — Final Mega Capstone Project

## Lesson 12: Portfolio, Interview Defense and Final Graduation

# 20.12.1 Portfolio structure

```text
README: problem, outcomes, quick architecture
docs/requirements: journeys, SLOs, RTO/RPO, constraints
docs/architecture: diagrams and ADRs
docs/security: threat model and evidence
docs/operations: dashboards, runbooks, incident/DR
docs/finops: allocation, forecast, unit economics
evidence/: sanitized test/game-day artifacts
demo/: repeatable presentation script
```

Remove credentials, internal endpoints, personal/customer data, and excessive raw logs. Use synthetic examples and redact account identifiers where appropriate.

# 20.12.2 Fifteen-minute defense

```text
0–2   business problem and requirements
2–5   architecture and data correctness
5–7   CI/security/supply chain
7–9   GitOps and progressive delivery
9–11  observability/SLO/incident
11–13 platform and FinOps value
13–15 failure evidence, tradeoffs, next improvements
```

Demonstrate one normal release and one controlled failure/recovery. Lead with outcomes, not screenshots of installed tools.

# 20.12.3 Interview questions

Be ready to answer:

1. Why EKS and this cluster/account topology?
2. How is duplicate payment prevented?
3. What happens when Git or Argo is unavailable?
4. How does a secret rotate without Git plaintext?
5. Why can the canary metric be trusted?
6. How do SLO and error budget alter delivery?
7. What fails during a regional partition?
8. How is split brain prevented?
9. How is tenant isolation tested?
10. How do you prove savings without harming reliability?
11. What does the platform own versus service teams?
12. Which assumption would most change the design?

# 20.12.4 Final architecture answer

> **I designed Atlas around explicit user journeys and reliability targets. Reviewed source produces one signed immutable artifact through short-lived CI identity; protected config Git promotes that digest, and Argo CD with Rollouts reconciles it to isolated EKS environments. PostgreSQL and an outbox provide transactional authority and retry-safe events. External Secrets and workload identity keep plaintext credentials out of Git. Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, OpenTelemetry, Grafana, and SLO burn alerts connect release evidence to user outcomes. The operating model includes ownership, on-call, runbooks, postmortems, capacity, backup, fencing, and tested regional recovery. A platform golden path packages these controls for teams, while FinOps allocation and cost per successful order keep engineering value visible. Every critical claim is backed by an automated test or game-day result.**

# 20.12.5 Graduation rubric

Score each 0–4:

```text
requirements and architecture
application/data correctness
automation and code quality
cloud/Kubernetes reliability
security and supply chain
GitOps and delivery
observability and SRE
DR and failure evidence
platform developer experience
FinOps and business value
documentation and communication
```

Minimum: no zero; at least 3 in correctness, security, SRE/DR; total at least 36/44. Any exposed credential or untested destructive procedure blocks graduation.

# 20.12.6 Never-forget masterclass map

```text
mental model → Git → Linux/network → automation → application
→ containers/artifacts → CI/security → Kubernetes/troubleshooting
→ IaC/AWS → GitOps → observability → SRE → system design
→ platform engineering → FinOps → production evidence
```

The final skill is not memorizing tools. It is connecting desired outcome, system behavior, evidence, safe change, recovery, ownership, and cost.

# 20.12.7 Portfolio narrative

Organize the portfolio around one statement:

```text
I designed, built, secured, operated, failed, recovered, and optimized
a production-style platform that protects an explicit customer journey.
```

Tools support that story. Lead with requirements, decisions, evidence, tradeoffs, and learning.

# 20.12.8 Sanitization checklist

Before publishing:

- remove credentials, tokens, account IDs, private endpoints, personal/customer data;
- replace sensitive resource names and security findings;
- remove Terraform state/plans containing secrets or infrastructure detail beyond policy;
- use synthetic dashboards/logs/traces;
- confirm employer/course/license permission for code/assets;
- preserve enough architecture reasoning without exposing attack paths;
- scan repository history, artifacts, images, issues, and screenshots—not only current files.

Keep a 60-second and 5-minute version too.

# 20.12.12 Live demo sequence

1. Show clean source and requirement/ADR.
2. Merge synthetic app change; show immutable build evidence.
3. Promote digest through GitOps canary.
4. Inject safe latency; observe SLO/trace/log/release.
5. Abort/recover and validate original SLI/data.
6. Create preview service through golden path.
7. Show ownership/cost/unit evidence and cleanup.

Pre-record a backup demo for unreliable internet; explain rather than hide failure.

# 20.12.13 Beginner interview bank

**What is DevOps?**  Cultural and technical practices improving collaboration, feedback, safe delivery, and operation across the software lifecycle.

**What is IaC?**  Versioned declarative/programmatic infrastructure intent applied through controlled tooling and state.

**What is Kubernetes?**  A control system that reconciles declared containerized workload state across cluster resources.

**What is GitOps?**  Versioned declarative desired state in Git with automated reconciliation and auditable change.

**What is observability?**  Ability to understand internal behavior from telemetry/evidence and answer new questions.

**What is SRE?**  Applying software engineering and explicit objectives/risk to sustainable operations.

**What is platform engineering?**  Building internal capabilities as a product to reduce developer cognitive load safely.

**What is FinOps?**  Cross-functional data-driven practice for technology/cloud cost and business value decisions.

# 20.12.14 Intermediate interview bank

**Deployment versus release?**  Deploy makes code available in runtime; release exposes capability/traffic to users, often controlled separately.

**Readiness versus liveness?**  Readiness controls new traffic; liveness detects inability to progress and may restart. Startup protects slow initialization.

**Request versus limit?**  Request guides Kubernetes scheduling/reservation; limit caps usage with resource-specific behavior.

**Counter versus gauge versus histogram?**  Accumulating events, current value, and bucketed distribution for aggregatable latency/size analysis.

**Sync versus healthy in Argo?**  Desired/live manifest agreement versus resource health assessment; neither alone proves customer health.

**RTO versus RPO?**  Acceptable recovery duration versus acceptable lost history in time.

**Showback versus chargeback?**  Cost visibility versus financial responsibility transfer.

# 20.12.15 Senior scenario bank

**Design safe deployment.**  Reviewed source, isolated CI, immutable artifact/provenance, config promotion, policy/admission, progressive traffic, customer SLI, automatic/manual abort, DB-compatible migration, release evidence.

**Debug intermittent checkout failures.**  Confirm SLI/scope/time/version/region, trace critical path, compare affected dimensions, inspect correlated safe logs/dependencies, test hypothesis, reversible mitigation, validate business outcome.

**EKS cost rose 40%.**  Validate allocation/data, decompose nodes/requests/idle/storage/network/telemetry/demand, compare unit cost/SLO, then safe usage/node/Spot/architecture/rate actions with realization.

**Queue backlog grows.**  Compare arrival/service rate and oldest age, dependency capacity/errors/retries/poison keys, scale within downstream limits, prioritize/load shed, drain/reconcile, prevent recurrence.

**Certificate rotation broke half pods.**  Scope by secret/config generation/instance, restore overlap/reload via source of truth, revoke safely, validate SLI/security, fix rotation contract/test.

# 20.12.16 Expert scenario bank

**Design multi-region checkout.**  Start with invariants/RTO/RPO/consistency, choose writer model, replication/lag, independent capacity/identity/keys/dependencies, routing, fencing, staged promotion, integrity, backlog/failback, tested cost.

**Design internal platform for 300 teams.**  Research journeys, stable capability APIs/golden paths, catalog ownership, tenant classes, secure supply chain, GitOps/IaC, policy/exception, SLO/support, upgrade/migration/deletion, DX/value/FinOps measures.

**Observability backend is down during incident.**  Independent edge/business/page canaries, low-dependency API/runtime evidence, bounded queues, cautious change, fallback communication, restore and reconcile blind interval; never equate UI loss with app failure.

**Leadership requests 30% cost cut.**  Clarify timeframe/value/risk, create reconciled cost/unit baseline, segment waste/usage/rate/architecture, protect SLO/security/RTO/RPO, prioritize experiments, forecast and verify realized savings.

# 20.12.17 Architecture defense questions

Prepare concise answers:

```text
Why EKS versus simpler runtime?
Why these service boundaries and database?
Why queue/outbox instead of synchronous call?
Why single writer and chosen DR?
Why Terraform/GitOps boundary?
What happens when Git/CI/Argo/Grafana/identity/provider fails?
Where are shared failure domains?
What is largest unresolved risk?
What changes at 10× traffic or 10× teams?
What would you buy/managed versus build?
How do you exit/teardown/migrate?
```

Answer with requirement, options, decision, consequence, and evidence.

# 20.12.18 Behavioral interview stories

Use STAR with engineering evidence:

```text
Situation: user/business risk and constraints
Task: your accountable outcome
Action: discovery, decision, collaboration, technical/control work
Result: measured SLI/time/cost/risk plus learning
```

Prepare stories about incident leadership, disagreement/tradeoff, failure/mistake, toil automation, security issue, cost optimization, mentoring/adoption, and ambiguous problem. Never invent employment experience; clearly label capstone simulations.

# 20.12.19 Certification completion matrix

Create current-objective rows for selected certifications:

```text
AWS architecture/DevOps/security
Terraform
Kubernetes/CKA or related
Argo/GitOps
Prometheus/OpenTelemetry
platform engineering
FinOps
```

Columns:

```text
official objective/link/version
plain-language explanation
capstone artifact
hands-on failure proof
practice score
weakness/review date
```

This course supports preparation; only official current exam guides define coverage.

# 20.12.20 Thirty-day revision plan

```text
Days 1–5: Linux/network/Git/cloud/IaC foundations
Days 6–10: containers/Kubernetes/EKS/security
Days 11–14: CI/supply chain/GitOps/progressive delivery
Days 15–18: Prometheus/PromQL/logs/traces/OTel
Days 19–21: SLO/on-call/incidents/DR
Days 22–24: system design/capacity/data/events
Days 25–26: platform product/multi-tenancy
Days 27–28: FinOps/allocation/unit/optimization
Day 29: full game day and postmortem
Day 30: portfolio defense and timed mock interview
```

Use active recall and rebuild/debug, not rereading only.

# 20.12.21 Final graduation rubric

Score 0–4:

```text
0 absent
1 explained
2 implemented happy path
3 failure/security/recovery tested
4 production tradeoff, automation, measurable outcome, and clear defense
```

Domains:

```text
requirements/architecture
AWS/network/identity/IaC
EKS/Kubernetes/platform baseline
application/data/events
CI/supply chain
GitOps/secrets/progressive delivery
observability/SLO
SRE/incident/DR
platform engineering/DX
FinOps/cost/unit economics
security/governance
documentation/communication
```

No zero; security/data integrity/restore must reach at least 3 before claiming graduation.

# 20.12.22 Honest limitations statement

Write:

```text
what was simulated rather than run
which managed-service/provider assumptions were not load-tested
known scale/security/compliance gaps
unverified RTO/RPO or pricing terms
features intentionally out of scope
what would be needed for real production
```

Honest limitations increase credibility.

# 20.12.23 Safe teardown and archive

Before deletion, export sanitized evidence and verify no required data/retention. Enumerate exact lab accounts/regions/resources from IaC/state/inventory, stop GitOps recreation, destroy in dependency order through source tools, check finalizers/external resources/snapshots/IP/DNS/registry/logs, revoke identities/keys, and verify billing/resource inventory later.

Never use broad recursive/destructive commands against unverified targets.

# 20.12.24 Final mastery declaration

You can call the masterclass complete when you can:

1. Explain any major choice in layman and expert language.
2. Rebuild the critical path from versioned source.
3. Prove checkout correctness under retry/crash.
4. Trace source -> artifact -> Git -> runtime -> customer SLI.
5. Detect/coordinate/mitigate/recover a hidden failure safely.
6. Restore data/service and measure RPO/RTO.
7. Provide a developer golden path with tested tenant/security boundaries.
8. Reconcile cost and improve unit value without harming objectives.
9. Defend tradeoffs, limitations, and next evolution in an interview.
10. Teardown safely with no orphan spend or exposed credentials.

# 20.12.25 The complete never-forget map

```text
USER VALUE
  -> requirements, invariants, SLI/SLO, unit economics
SOURCE
  -> review, ownership, tests, secure CI, provenance
DESIRED STATE
  -> Terraform + GitOps + policy + secrets references
RUNTIME
  -> AWS/EKS + identity + network + data + capacity
EVIDENCE
  -> metrics + logs + traces + releases + billing
OPERATIONS
  -> page + runbook + incident command + mitigation
RECOVERY
  -> backup + fencing + restore/failover + integrity + failback
PLATFORM
  -> golden path + API + tenancy + upgrades + DX
VALUE LOOP
  -> allocate + forecast + optimize + realize + learn
```

The master principle is: **make the valuable outcome explicit, automate the safe path, observe the real behavior, contain failure, prove recovery, and improve from evidence.**

# 20.12.26 Professional Mastery Workbook

This workbook expands **Portfolio, Interview Defense and Final Graduation** into deliberate practice without replacing the authored tutorial above.

Use it after reading the core explanation. The goal is not to memorize thousands of lines; the goal is to repeatedly explain, build, break, secure, observe, recover, and defend the lesson in different conditions.

## Workbook learning contract

- Concepts covered: 25 lesson-specific anchors.
- Progression: beginner, intermediate, expert, professional, industry-ready, certification review, and interview defense.
- Safety: use synthetic data, disposable resources, explicit placeholders, least privilege, and bounded failure experiments.
- Completion: retain commands or configuration, observations, screenshots or query output, decisions, rollback evidence, and a short reflection.
- Quality rule: a passing answer states assumptions, protects a user or business outcome, names ownership, and validates the final result end to end.
- Currency rule: verify current official documentation, versions, limits, pricing, and certification objectives before relying on changing product behavior.

## Seven-stage progression

| Stage | Learner must demonstrate |
|---|---|
| Beginner | Explain the concept in plain language and give one safe example. |
| Intermediate | Connect components, data, control flow, and normal operating behavior. |
| Expert | Analyze trade-offs, edge cases, scaling pressure, and correlated failures. |
| Professional | Make a reviewed decision with owner, evidence, rollout, and rollback. |
| Industry-ready | Operate the design under security, failure, recovery, cost, and compliance constraints. |
| Certification review | Map durable concepts to the latest official objectives without relying on stale wording. |
| Interview defense | Answer concisely, clarify assumptions, draw the model, and defend alternatives. |
