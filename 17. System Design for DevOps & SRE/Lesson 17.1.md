# Module 17 — System Design for DevOps/SRE

## Lesson 1: Requirements, Constraints and the System Model

System design is disciplined tradeoff reasoning. Begin with behavior and constraints; technologies come later.

# 17.1.1 Requirement frame

```text
functional      what users and integrations must do
quality         availability, latency, durability, security, cost
scale           traffic, data, tenants, regions, growth
operational     deploy, observe, recover, audit, support
constraints     team, deadline, regulation, existing systems
out of scope    intentionally excluded behavior
```

Convert vague language into measurable objectives. “Highly available” becomes a journey SLO and failure model. “Fast” becomes a percentile latency under defined load and payload.

# 17.1.2 Start from critical journeys

For an order service:

```text
create order
read order status
cancel order before fulfillment
process payment callback
publish fulfillment event
```

For each, define correctness, idempotency, consistency, latency, availability, data loss tolerance, and dependency behavior.

# 17.1.3 Context diagram

```text
customer ─► edge/API ─► order service ─► database
                         │      │
                         │      └────► payment provider
                         └───────────► event bus ─► fulfillment
```

Mark trust boundaries, authoritative data owners, synchronous dependencies, and failure domains. Every arrow is a latency, security, capacity, and availability dependency.

# 17.1.4 Architecture decision record

```markdown
# ADR: Store order state in relational database
Status: Accepted
Context: transactional state transitions and query needs
Decision: managed PostgreSQL, one writer, read replicas
Alternatives: DynamoDB, document database
Consequences: schema migrations and regional-write strategy required
Evidence: load test, recovery test, cost estimate
```

Record why and consequences, not just the chosen product.

# 17.1.5 Lab

Design a URL shortener or order service. Produce requirements, SLOs, load assumptions, context diagram, data ownership, failure model, three ADRs, and open questions. Review which assumption would most change the architecture.

# 17.1.6 Interview structure

> **I clarify journeys and scale, quantify quality attributes, draw the context and data flow, identify state and consistency, estimate capacity, design the normal path, then examine failure, security, delivery, observability, recovery, and cost. I make tradeoffs explicit and revisit the highest-risk assumption.**

# 17.1.7 Beginner mental model: design is choosing under limits

System design is not drawing the most boxes. It is deciding how a system should meet valuable outcomes despite limited time, money, people, capacity, and technology.

```text
requirements + constraints + assumptions
          -> options and tradeoffs
          -> architecture
          -> validation evidence
          -> revised decisions
```

A good design explains why each important component exists and what happens when it fails.

# 17.1.8 Functional and quality requirements

Functional requirements describe behavior:

```text
create, read, update, and delete a todo
share a list with another user
notify a user when a deadline approaches
```

Quality attributes describe how well:

```text
availability, latency, correctness, durability
scale, security, privacy, compliance
operability, maintainability, cost, portability
RTO/RPO and data residency
```

Make them measurable. “Fast and scalable” is vague; “P99 create latency below 500 ms at 5,000 requests/s” is testable.

# 17.1.9 Constraints versus assumptions

```text
constraint: production data must remain in India
constraint: team supports PostgreSQL and Kubernetes today
assumption: peak traffic is 10× average
assumption: 80% of operations are reads
decision: start with one regional PostgreSQL writer
```

Assumptions need owners and validation dates. If an assumption is wrong, the decision may change without anyone having made a bad choice.

# 17.1.10 Prioritize and resolve conflicts

Requirements conflict:

```text
strong consistency vs multi-region write latency
high availability vs cost
fast feature delivery vs change risk
long retention vs privacy/cost
custom platform flexibility vs cognitive load
```

Ask the accountable stakeholder which tradeoff protects the critical journey. Record rejected alternatives and consequences.

# 17.1.11 User journeys and invariants

Write each journey as steps and identify invariants—facts that must always remain true:

```text
Create todo:
authenticate -> validate -> persist -> acknowledge -> publish event

Invariants:
one idempotency key cannot create two todos
an acknowledged create must be retrievable
unauthorized user cannot read another list
eventual notification cannot precede authoritative persistence
```

Invariants guide database, transaction, retry, and security design better than product names do.

# 17.1.12 Scope and non-goals

Declare the first design boundary:

```text
IN SCOPE
API, persistence, reminders, production operations for 1 million users

OUT OF SCOPE FOR V1
real-time collaborative editing, offline conflict merge, public marketplace

FUTURE PRESSURE
multi-region read latency and enterprise tenant isolation
```

Non-goals prevent an interview or project from expanding without limit. Revisit them when requirements change.

# 17.1.13 Context and container diagrams

Start broad:

```text
[User] -> [Todo System] -> [Identity Provider]
                         -> [Email Provider]
```

Then show major runtime containers:

```text
client -> edge/load balancer -> API -> PostgreSQL
                                  -> queue -> worker -> email provider
operators -> observability / delivery control planes
```

Label trust boundaries, protocols, data ownership, synchronous/asynchronous calls, and failure assumptions. Do not begin with internal classes.

# 17.1.14 Data-flow and trust-boundary view

Trace one sensitive operation:

```text
credential/token enters edge
-> identity validated
-> tenant/user authorization enforced
-> todo content encrypted in transit
-> persistence encrypted with controlled key
-> audit event records safe identity/action
-> logs/traces exclude token and prohibited content
```

This reveals security decisions that a component diagram hides.

# 17.1.15 Real hands-on: requirement discovery workshop

For the todo system, answer:

1. Who are the users and business owner?
2. What are the top three journeys and invariants?
3. What is average/peak traffic and data growth?
4. What latency/availability/durability/RTO/RPO is actually required?
5. What data classification/residency applies?
6. Which dependencies and team skills constrain choices?
7. What can degrade or wait asynchronously?
8. What is deliberately excluded from version one?

Mark every unknown as an assumption with a validation plan.

# 17.1.16 Architecture decision record example

```markdown
# ADR-004: Use a queue for reminder delivery

Status: Accepted
Context: API acknowledgement must not depend on email provider latency.
Decision: Persist todo, publish through transactional outbox, process asynchronously.
Alternatives: synchronous email; scheduled DB polling.
Consequences: eventual delivery, duplicate handling, queue monitoring, DLQ/replay.
Validation: load test, duplicate event test, provider outage game day.
Owner/review: Team Todo, review at 10× volume or new channel requirement.
```

# 17.1.17 Failure-mode table before implementation

| Component/boundary | Failure | User effect | Control | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Identity | slow/unavailable | login/create blocked | bounded timeout, cached safe session policy | latency/error SLI |
| Database | writer unavailable | creates fail | HA/failover, queue only if semantics allow | write SLI, DB state |
| Queue | backlog | reminders late | age SLO, scaling, DLQ | oldest message age |
| Email | rejected | notification delayed/lost | retry budget, classification, fallback | delivery outcomes |

Design prevention, containment, detection, and recovery for high risks.

# 17.1.18 Review with Well-Architected lenses

Evaluate operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability. These lenses expose missing questions; they do not mechanically decide the architecture.

For every review item, record current state, evidence, risk, owner, decision, and review date. Avoid checkbox compliance without user outcome.

# 17.1.19 Interview whiteboard structure

```text
0–5 min   clarify users, journeys, scope, quality targets
5–10 min  estimate traffic/data and state assumptions
10–20 min draw high-level flow and data ownership
20–30 min deep-dive critical tradeoff
30–38 min failure, security, observability, capacity, DR
38–42 min evolution, cost, and recap decisions
```

Say why. Interviewers usually value a coherent decision under requirements more than a fashionable component.

# 17.1.20 Certification and interview preparation

System-design reasoning supports cloud-architecture and DevOps/SRE certification scenarios. Always use current official certification objectives and service limits.

**Beginner: Functional versus non-functional requirement?**  Functional states what the system does; quality requirements state measurable properties such as latency, availability, security, and cost.

**Intermediate: Constraint versus assumption?**  A constraint is a required boundary; an assumption is believed true but must be validated and can change.

**Intermediate: Why define non-goals?**  They protect scope and make tradeoffs explicit.

**Senior: What do you clarify first in a design interview?**  Users, critical journeys/invariants, scale, quality objectives, data/security, constraints, and scope.

**Senior: Why write ADRs?**  They preserve context, considered options, decision, consequences, evidence, and revisit conditions.

**Expert: How do you handle conflicting requirements?**  Quantify the tradeoff, identify accountable stakeholder/user risk, propose options/fallbacks, and record the decision and consequence.

**Architect: What proves a design is operable?**  Ownership, objectives, telemetry, alert/runbook, capacity, failure behavior, safe delivery, security, backup/DR, and tested operational paths.

**Never-forget answer:** requirements drive architecture. State assumptions, protect invariants, explain tradeoffs, and validate the failure behavior.

# 17.1.21 Professional Mastery Workbook

This workbook expands **Requirements, Constraints and the System Model** into deliberate practice without replacing the authored tutorial above.

Use it after reading the core explanation. The goal is not to memorize thousands of lines; the goal is to repeatedly explain, build, break, secure, observe, recover, and defend the lesson in different conditions.

## Workbook learning contract

- Concepts covered: 20 lesson-specific anchors.
- Progression: beginner, intermediate, expert, professional, industry-ready, certification review, and interview defense.
- Safety: use synthetic data, disposable resources, explicit placeholders, least privilege, and bounded failure experiments.
- Completion: retain commands or configuration, observations, screenshots or query output, decisions, rollback evidence, and a short reflection.
- Quality rule: a passing answer states assumptions, protects a user or business outcome, names ownership, and validates the final result end to end.
- Currency rule: verify current official documentation, versions, limits, pricing, and certification objectives before relying on changing product behavior.

## Seven-stage progression

| Stage | Learner must demonstrate |
|---|---|
| Beginner | Explain the concept in plain language and give one safe example. |
| Intermediate | Connect components, data, control flow, and normal operating behavior. |
| Expert | Analyze trade-offs, edge cases, scaling pressure, and correlated failures. |
| Professional | Make a reviewed decision with owner, evidence, rollout, and rollback. |
| Industry-ready | Operate the design under security, failure, recovery, cost, and compliance constraints. |
| Certification review | Map durable concepts to the latest official objectives without relying on stale wording. |
| Interview defense | Answer concisely, clarify assumptions, draw the model, and defend alternatives. |

## HLD and LLD - the complete design chain

High-level design decides system boundaries, responsibilities, interactions, data authority, topology, quality attributes, and major trade-offs. Low-level design turns those decisions into interfaces, schemas, state machines, algorithms, concurrency rules, failure semantics, instrumentation, and tests.

HLD without LLD can look convincing while hiding impossible contracts. LLD without HLD can produce clean code that solves the wrong boundary or violates a system objective. Every decision below therefore requires a trace from user outcome to production evidence.

| Design level | Primary question | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|
| HLD | What system should exist, why, and under which constraints? | Context, containers, flows, data authority, topology, SLOs, threats, capacity, ADRs, and operations. |
| LLD | Exactly how will each unit behave and remain correct? | Interfaces, schemas, states, algorithms, errors, concurrency, tests, telemetry, and rollout compatibility. |
| Traceability | How does implementation prove the architecture promise? | Requirement IDs, contracts, test IDs, dashboards, runbooks, change evidence, and review decisions. |

### Mandatory diagram set

- HLD diagrams: system context, containers or services, end-to-end sequence, data flow, trust boundaries, deployment topology, failure domains, and multi-region or recovery state where relevant.
- LLD diagrams: component or package view, class or collaboration view where useful, detailed sequence, state machine, schema or entity relationship, concurrency ownership, and rollout or migration state.
- Diagram rule: every box needs a responsibility and owner; every arrow needs a protocol, direction, data, authentication, timeout, retry, and failure meaning where applicable.
- Evidence rule: diagrams are hypotheses until configuration, code, test output, runtime signals, and recovery behavior agree with them.

## Visual memory atlas

These diagrams turn the lesson into visual recall cues. Render Mermaid in a compatible Markdown preview, then practice redrawing each diagram without looking.

Use the **memory hook** as the shortest possible reconstruction key. During an interview or incident, draw the main boxes first, add arrows second, and annotate constraints, failure, identity, and evidence last.

### Visual 01 - HLD-to-LLD evidence chain

Memory hook: **WHY - WHERE - HOW - PROOF**.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    R["Requirements and constraints"] --> H["HLD boundaries, flows, data, topology"]
    H --> L["LLD interfaces, schemas, states, algorithms"]
    L --> C["Code and configuration"]
    C --> T["Tests and failure exercises"]
    T --> O["Runtime telemetry and user outcomes"]
    O --> D{"Promise proved?"}
    D -->|"No"| R
    D -->|"Yes"| A["Approved evidence"]
```

How to read it: Requirements explain why; HLD chooses boundaries and topology; LLD defines exact behavior; tests and telemetry prove the promise.

Recall drill: close the diagram, redraw it from the memory hook, label every arrow, then explain one failure and one security concern.

### Visual 02 - Architecture zoom levels

Memory hook: **Context - Containers - Components - Code**.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    X["Context: users and external systems"] --> N["Containers: applications and data stores"]
    N --> P["Components: responsibilities and contracts"]
    P --> C["Code: modules, classes, functions, schemas"]
    D["Deployment: nodes, zones, regions, networks"] --> N
    S["Sequences: runtime interactions"] --> P
    E["Evidence: tests and telemetry"] --> C
```

How to read it: Move from the outside world to deployable units, internal collaborators, and implementation detail without mixing abstraction levels.

Recall drill: close the diagram, redraw it from the memory hook, label every arrow, then explain one failure and one security concern.

### Visual 03 - Requirement funnel

Memory hook: **WHO - WHAT - HOW WELL - LIMITS**.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A["Actors and business outcome"] --> B["Critical user journeys"]
    B --> C["Functional requirements"]
    C --> D["Quality attributes and SLOs"]
    D --> E["Constraints and non-goals"]
    E --> F["Architecture decisions"]
    F --> G["Measurable acceptance evidence"]
```

How to read it: Start with people and journeys, then quality attributes and hard constraints, before selecting architecture.

Recall drill: close the diagram, redraw it from the memory hook, label every arrow, then explain one failure and one security concern.

### Visual 04 - System context and trust boundary

Memory hook: **People outside, system inside, trust at every arrow**.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    User["Customer"] -->|"HTTPS + identity"| System["Order platform"]
    Operator["Operator"] -->|"Privileged workflow"| System
    System -->|"Payment request"| Payment["Payment provider"]
    System -->|"Events"| Fulfillment["Fulfillment partner"]
    System -->|"Telemetry"| Observe["Observability platform"]
    subgraph TrustBoundary["Owned trust boundary"]
        System
    end
```

How to read it: The boundary makes external actors, dependencies, data movement, and trust decisions visible.

Recall drill: close the diagram, redraw it from the memory hook, label every arrow, then explain one failure and one security concern.

### Visual 05 - Critical journey sequence

Memory hook: **Accept - Validate - Decide - Persist - Confirm**.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor U as User
    participant A as API
    participant D as Domain service
    participant S as State store
    participant E as Event publisher
    U->>A: Submit command
    A->>D: Validate identity and intent
    D->>S: Commit invariant-preserving state
    S-->>D: Durable result
    D->>E: Publish outcome
    D-->>A: Stable response
    A-->>U: Confirmation
```

How to read it: A sequence diagram exposes ordering, synchronous latency, authoritative writes, and failure boundaries.

Recall drill: close the diagram, redraw it from the memory hook, label every arrow, then explain one failure and one security concern.

### Visual 06 - Assumption-to-decision loop

Memory hook: **Assume - Measure - Decide - Prove - Revisit**.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Assumption"] --> B["Risk if wrong"]
    B --> C["Cheapest useful measurement"]
    C --> D{"Evidence sufficient?"}
    D -->|"No"| C
    D -->|"Yes"| E["ADR decision"]
    E --> F["Implementation and test"]
    F --> G["Production evidence"]
    G --> H{"Trigger changed?"}
    H -->|"Yes"| A
    H -->|"No"| I["Keep decision"]
```

How to read it: Unverified assumptions become explicit experiments and architecture decisions with revisit triggers.

Recall drill: close the diagram, redraw it from the memory hook, label every arrow, then explain one failure and one security concern.
