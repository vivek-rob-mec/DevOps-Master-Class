# Module 18 — Platform Engineering

## Lesson 7: Infrastructure, GitOps and Environment Provisioning

# 18.7.1 Ownership chain

```text
platform claim
→ validated desired state
→ Terraform/cloud controller provisions foundation
→ bootstrap installs GitOps control
→ Argo reconciles platform and workload configuration
→ status returns to platform user
```

Define one owner per field/resource. Terraform and Argo should not fight over the same Kubernetes object. Git should retain the auditable desired state; runtime status belongs in control-plane status, not continually committed back to Git.

# 18.7.2 Environment classes

```yaml
classes:
  development-small:
    ttl: 72h
    cluster: shared-dev
    database: postgres-small
    backups: daily-3d
  production-critical:
    cluster: dedicated-prod
    multi_az: true
    database: postgres-ha
    backups: pitr-35d
    approval: change-management
```

Users choose intent and business tier; the platform maps it to governed implementation. Make cost and SLO consequences visible before creation.

# 18.7.3 Provisioning workflow

```text
validate identity/quota/policy
reserve name and record operation
open/merge desired-state change
provision cloud dependencies
bootstrap GitOps application
wait for meaningful readiness
publish endpoints/credentials references
record cost/ownership and expiry
```

Compensating deletion must respect retained data and legal requirements. Never automatically delete a production database because a later monitoring step failed.

# 18.7.4 Drift and break-glass

Detect cloud, Kubernetes, Git, and platform-record drift. Emergency changes require scoped access, audit, incident/change link, expiry, and reconciliation to authoritative code. Do not normalize manual production mutation as self-service.

# 18.7.5 Lab

Design a preview-environment workflow from pull request open to close. Include unique DNS, namespace, secrets, database choice, sanitized data, quotas, TTL, status comments, concurrency, cost, cleanup, and orphan detection.

# 18.7.6 Interview answer

> **I expose versioned environment classes rather than raw infrastructure. A reconciler validates policy and ownership, commits or applies desired state through a clear Terraform/GitOps boundary, reports durable status, and handles idempotency, partial failure, TTL, retained data, and deletion. Break-glass changes are audited and reconciled back to code.**

# 18.7.7 Beginner mental model: order form plus tracked construction

A self-service environment should work like a governed order: the user selects a supported class, the platform validates authorization/budget, commits intent, constructs resources, reports progress, and maintains them. It is not an untracked shell script with cloud-admin credentials.

# 18.7.8 Environment classes

```text
preview: short-lived, synthetic data, small quota, auto-delete
development: persistent team sandbox, lower availability
staging: production-like integration, controlled test data
production: strict identity, HA/DR, on-call, change policy
regulated: isolated accounts/regions/keys/audit as required
```

Each class defines capability, SLO, quota, data, security, cost, support, retention, and lifecycle.

# 18.7.9 Ownership chain

```text
platform API owns environment intent/status
IaC owns cloud resources
GitOps owns Kubernetes desired state
secret system owns secret material
catalog owns service/team relationship
cloud/runtime provide actual state
```

Avoid two sources independently changing the same property. Define how drift is detected and reconciled.

# 18.7.10 Provisioning workflow

```text
request -> auth/quota/policy/cost estimate
-> reviewed/automatic approval by class
-> commit versioned intent
-> IaC plan/apply with state lock
-> GitOps bootstrap and workloads
-> smoke/security/telemetry validation
-> status/catalog/cost link
-> handoff with expiry/support
```

Use durable operation ID and idempotent stages so retry cannot create duplicate VPCs or clusters.

# 18.7.11 Infrastructure state and locking

Protect IaC state with controlled backend, encryption, identity, locking, version history, backup/recovery, and audit. State may contain sensitive values; restrict access and avoid outputting secrets.

Detect stale locks carefully. Do not force-unlock until the exact operation/owner is verified and competing apply is excluded.

# 18.7.12 GitOps bootstrap

Bootstrap in layers:

```text
cluster prerequisites and identities
-> Argo CD/control components
-> AppProjects/repositories/clusters
-> platform add-ons/policy/telemetry
-> tenant namespaces/baselines
-> applications
```

Use version-pinned declarative setup, health/order controls, and recovery docs. Protect repository and cluster credentials.

# 18.7.13 Ephemeral preview environments

Tie environment identity to a reviewed change, owner, TTL, quota, and synthetic/sanitized data. Clean up cloud resources, DNS, certificates, databases, PVC/snapshots, secrets, GitOps objects, and catalog entries.

Renew TTL explicitly with audit. Alert owners before deletion and block removal when retention/legal conditions require it.

# 18.7.14 Drift and break-glass

Normal drift flow:

```text
detect desired != actual
-> classify benign/unsafe/emergency
-> reconcile automatically or notify by policy
```

Break-glass:

```text
declare incident + authorize scoped identity
-> make minimal audited change
-> validate mitigation
-> encode/revert change in Git/IaC
-> reconcile and revoke access
-> review
```

Never leave the emergency change as undocumented truth.

# 18.7.15 Secrets and workload identity

Provision references and identities, not plaintext secret values in Git/state/output. Use workload identity to access approved cloud/secret resources. Define rotation, revocation, deletion, and recovery.

Ensure preview environments cannot request production roles or secret paths.

# 18.7.16 Real hands-on: self-service preview environment

Implement a lab request:

```yaml
owner: team-todo
class: preview
sourceRevision: synthetic-pr-42
ttlHours: 24
region: approved-lab-region
dataProfile: synthetic
```

Pipeline produces plan, policy result, Git/IaC change, namespace/GitOps application, URL, telemetry, cost tag, and status. Close the change and verify complete deletion/inventory reconciliation.

# 18.7.17 Failure lab: IaC succeeds, GitOps fails

After cloud resource creation, reject the GitOps manifest. The workflow must show partial state, retain ownership, retry safely after fix, or execute reviewed compensation. It must not report “environment failed” while leaking unowned resources.

# 18.7.18 Failure lab: manual cloud drift

Change a synthetic resource outside IaC. Run plan/detection and classify:

```text
revert automatically if safe
import/adopt through reviewed intent
open incident/security investigation
time-bound approved exception
```

Test that drift visibility does not print sensitive state.

# 18.7.19 Failure lab: deletion with protected data

Attempt to delete an environment containing a retained snapshot/legal-hold marker. The workflow should stop destructive steps, explain the blocking policy, preserve billing/ownership, and require authorized resolution.

# 18.7.20 Environment SLO and telemetry

Measure request acceptance, provisioning duration/success, status freshness, drift detection/reconciliation, deletion completeness, provider errors/quotas, environment cost, orphan resources, and support tickets. Separate provider waiting from platform processing.

# 18.7.21 Production checklist

- Classes and shared responsibilities are documented.
- Server-side auth/policy/quota/data/region controls apply.
- Intent/state/actual ownership and locking are clear.
- Workflow is idempotent and exposes partial state.
- GitOps bootstrap/order/recovery are versioned/tested.
- Secrets remain out of Git/state/logs where prohibited.
- Drift and emergency reconciliation are governed.
- Preview TTL/deletion covers external resources.
- Backup/restore and provider/control-plane outage are tested.
- Cost, SLO, support, upgrade, and decommission have owners.

# 18.7.22 Certification and interview preparation

This lesson maps to IaC, GitOps, cloud governance, platform API, and environment-lifecycle skills. Check current certification tools/objectives.

**Beginner: Why combine IaC and GitOps?**  IaC manages cloud/infrastructure desired state; GitOps continuously reconciles Kubernetes/application configuration, with explicit ownership boundaries.

**Intermediate: Why environment classes?**  They package proportional security, reliability, data, quota, cost, support, and lifecycle defaults.

**Intermediate: What is drift?**  Actual state differs from authoritative desired state; policy decides reconciliation, adoption, exception, or incident.

**Senior: How do you retry partial provisioning?**  Durable operation identity/state, idempotent steps, exact resource ownership, state locks, retry/compensation/manual repair, and audit.

**Senior: How does break-glass work with GitOps?**  Scoped approved emergency change, audit, user validation, then immediate Git/source-of-truth reconciliation and access revocation.

**Expert: How do you safely delete an environment?**  Discover exact owned external resources, apply retention/legal/data policy, checkpoint/audit, ordered deletion, verify no orphan cost/data/identity, and preserve required recovery evidence.

**Architect: What survives control-plane loss?**  Running workloads should where designed; recovery restores identity/state/GitOps, queues changes safely, uses audited emergency procedures, and reconciles afterward.

**Never-forget answer:** self-service provisioning is a lifecycle controller. Govern intent, state, partial failure, drift, secrets, cost, and deletion—not just creation.

# 18.7.23 Professional Mastery Workbook

This workbook expands **Infrastructure, GitOps and Environment Provisioning** into deliberate practice without replacing the authored tutorial above.

Use it after reading the core explanation. The goal is not to memorize thousands of lines; the goal is to repeatedly explain, build, break, secure, observe, recover, and defend the lesson in different conditions.

## Workbook learning contract

- Concepts covered: 22 lesson-specific anchors.
- Progression: beginner, intermediate, expert, professional, industry-ready, certification review, and interview defense.
- Safety: use synthetic data, disposable resources, explicit placeholders, least privilege, and bounded failure experiments.
- Completion: retain commands or configuration, observations, screenshots or query output, decisions, rollback evidence, and a short reflection.
- Quality rule: a passing answer states assumptions, protects a user or business outcome, names ownership, and validates the final result end to end.
- Currency rule: verify current official documentation, versions, limits, pricing, and certification objectives before relying on changing product behavior.

## Seven-stage progression

| Stage | Learner must demonstrate |
|---|---|
| Beginner | Explain the concept in plain language and give one safe example. |
| Intermediate | Connect components, data, control flow, and normal operating behavior. |
| Expert | Analyze trade-offs, edge cases, scaling pressure, and correlated failures. |
| Professional | Make a reviewed decision with owner, evidence, rollout, and rollback. |
| Industry-ready | Operate the design under security, failure, recovery, cost, and compliance constraints. |
| Certification review | Map durable concepts to the latest official objectives without relying on stale wording. |
| Interview defense | Answer concisely, clarify assumptions, draw the model, and defend alternatives. |
