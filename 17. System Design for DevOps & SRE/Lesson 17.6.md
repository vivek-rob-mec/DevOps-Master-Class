# Module 17 — System Design for DevOps/SRE

## Lesson 6: Queues and Event-driven Systems

# 17.6.1 Why asynchronous boundaries

Queues absorb bursts, decouple availability, control concurrency, and allow independent scaling. They also introduce delay, duplicate delivery, ordering limits, poison messages, and operational state.

```text
producer → durable queue/topic → consumer group → database/service
                 │
                 └──────────────► dead-letter/quarantine workflow
```

# 17.6.2 Delivery semantics

Infrastructure commonly provides at-least-once delivery. Exactly-once business outcome requires application design:

```text
stable event ID
idempotent handler or deduplication record
atomic state transition where possible
retry-safe side effects
observable duplicate handling
```

Do not acknowledge until the intended durable outcome exists. Set visibility/ack deadline longer than normal processing with safe extension, but bounded enough for recovery.

# 17.6.3 Ordering

Global ordering limits scale and availability. Prefer ordering per entity or partition key. Consumers must handle reordering, delayed events, and schema evolution.

Envelope:

```json
{
  "id":"evt-123",
  "type":"OrderCreated",
  "version":2,
  "occurred_at":"2026-08-15T10:00:00Z",
  "producer":"order-api",
  "traceparent":"00-...",
  "data":{}
}
```

# 17.6.4 Backpressure

Monitor oldest message age, ingress/egress rate, depth, retry count, DLQ growth, processing latency, and consumer saturation. Depth alone can be normal during a short burst; age shows user delay.

Scale consumers within dependency capacity. More consumers can overload the database. Use bounded retries with jitter, then quarantine and alert by impact.

# 17.6.5 Lab

Build producer/worker processing. Inject duplicate, out-of-order, poison, slow, and lost-ack cases. Prove one business outcome, correct retry/DLQ behavior, trace correlation, and controlled database load.

# 17.6.6 Beginner mental model: a restaurant order rail

A waiter does not stand beside the cook until a meal is ready. The order is recorded, queued, processed, and eventually completed. A queue separates the producer's pace and availability from the consumer's work.

```text
producer -> durable message -> broker/queue -> consumer -> result
```

The separation improves resilience and burst handling, but introduces delay, duplicate delivery, ordering, backlog, and harder end-to-end reasoning.

# 17.6.7 Queue versus event log versus stream

```text
work queue: each job is normally handled by one consumer group worker
pub/sub: several subscribers receive an event
durable log/stream: ordered partitioned history can be replayed by consumers
```

Products combine these ideas differently. Choose from consumer count, retention/replay, ordering, throughput, fan-out, and operations.

# 17.6.8 Message contract

```json
{
  "event_id": "01J-SYNTHETIC",
  "event_type": "TodoCreated",
  "schema_version": 1,
  "occurred_at": "2026-08-15T10:20:31Z",
  "producer": "todo-api",
  "tenant_id": "synthetic-tenant",
  "aggregate_id": "synthetic-todo",
  "aggregate_version": 7,
  "traceparent": "synthetic-valid-format-in-real-system",
  "data": {"safe_field": "example"}
}
```

Keep payload minimal, classified, and versioned. Consumers must not trust producer-supplied authorization blindly.

# 17.6.9 At-most-once, at-least-once, and exactly-once claims

```text
at-most-once  -> may lose, avoids broker redelivery
at-least-once -> retries delivery, so duplicates are possible
exactly-once  -> only meaningful within precisely stated boundaries/operations
```

End-to-end business “exactly once” is usually achieved through idempotency/deduplication and transactional state, not faith in a marketing label.

# 17.6.10 Idempotent consumer

In one database transaction where possible:

```text
check/insert processed(event_id, consumer)
apply business state transition if not already processed
commit
acknowledge message only after durable commit
```

Handle concurrent duplicates with a uniqueness constraint. Define dedup retention and what happens after expiry/replay.

# 17.6.11 Visibility timeout and acknowledgement

Many queues hide a received message for a lease/visibility period. If the consumer does not acknowledge before it expires, another delivery can occur.

Set visibility above normal processing with extension/heartbeat where supported, but keep failure recovery timely. Acknowledging before durable side effects risks loss; after non-idempotent side effects risks duplicates.

# 17.6.12 Ordering and partitioning

Global ordering limits parallelism. Prefer ordering per aggregate/tenant/key:

```text
partition key = todo_id
events for one todo ordered
different todos processed in parallel
```

Hot keys reduce parallelism. Consumers should use aggregate version or business state to reject stale/out-of-order changes safely.

# 17.6.13 Backpressure and queue-age objective

Queue depth alone is hard to interpret. Track oldest eligible message age and processing latency relative to a freshness SLO.

```text
arrival rate > service rate -> backlog grows
drain rate = consumer capacity - new arrival rate
drain time ≈ backlog / net drain rate
```

Scale consumers only within database/API quotas. More workers can overload the dependency.

# 17.6.14 Dead-letter queues

After a bounded receive/attempt policy, isolate messages that cannot progress. A DLQ is not a graveyard.

Define owner, alarm/ticket urgency, retention, inspection without leaking data, repair, replay authorization/rate/idempotency, and deletion policy. Classify permanent validation failures separately from transient dependency failures.

# 17.6.15 Transactional outbox and inbox

Producer transaction:

```text
write todo + outbox record atomically
publisher retries until broker accepts
duplicate publish remains possible
```

Consumer inbox/deduplication records processed identity with business update. Monitor unpublished outbox age and processed retention.

# 17.6.16 Saga design

For several services:

```text
OrderStarted -> ReserveInventory -> AuthorizePayment -> ConfirmOrder
```

On failure, business compensation might release inventory or void authorization. Decide orchestration versus choreography, timeouts, state visibility, idempotency, manual repair, audit, and what cannot be compensated.

# 17.6.17 Real hands-on: todo reminder worker

Build:

1. API writes todo plus outbox row.
2. Publisher sends `TodoCreated` with stable ID/version.
3. Worker consumes and schedules reminder idempotently.
4. Success acknowledges only after durable state.
5. Transient failures retry with jitter/bounds.
6. Permanent failures enter DLQ with safe reason.
7. Logs/traces propagate context; metrics track age/attempt/result.

# 17.6.18 Failure lab: duplicate and crash timing

Crash the consumer:

```text
before business commit
after commit but before acknowledgement
during external side effect
```

Redeliver and prove correct final state. External email may need a provider idempotency key or an explicit “duplicate notification possible” business decision.

# 17.6.19 Failure lab: poison message and backlog

Send one malformed message plus a burst. Ensure the poison message does not block an ordered partition forever, retries are bounded, DLQ receives it, healthy work continues according to ordering rules, and queue age alerts before objective breach.

Repair and replay through a controlled audited tool with a batch/rate stop condition.

# 17.6.20 Schema evolution

Use additive changes first, version contracts, maintain tolerant readers within reason, and test old/new producer-consumer combinations. Never silently reuse a field with different meaning.

Maintain a compatibility policy and consumer inventory before removing fields. Replay means old events may exist long after producers migrate.

# 17.6.21 Security and operability

- Authenticate producers/consumers with least-privilege topics/queues.
- Encrypt transport/storage and protect keys.
- Validate schema, size, tenant, and safe attributes.
- Restrict replay/purge/DLQ access and audit it.
- Avoid sensitive payloads; use references with authorization when appropriate.
- Apply quotas/fairness to prevent one tenant flooding shared work.
- Monitor publish/consume errors, lag/age, duplicates, retries, DLQ, and reconciliation.

# 17.6.22 Certification and interview preparation

Messaging semantics are common in cloud architecture examinations; verify current broker-specific guarantees.

**Beginner: Why use a queue?**  Decouple producer from consumer time/availability and buffer bursts.

**Intermediate: What does at-least-once mean?**  A message may be delivered again, so consumers need idempotent behavior.

**Intermediate: What is a DLQ?**  An isolated destination for messages that exceed defined processing policy, with ownership and repair/replay lifecycle.

**Senior: How do you prevent DB commit without event publication?**  Record business state and outbox event atomically, then publish asynchronously with duplicate-safe consumers.

**Senior: How do you choose partition key?**  From required ordering and access/load distribution; per-aggregate ordering balances correctness and parallelism.

**Expert: How do you recover a large backlog?**  Preserve priority/fairness, calculate net drain capacity, scale within dependencies, reduce retry waste, monitor age, and control replay/load shedding.

**Architect: What does exactly once mean?**  Demand the exact boundary. Broker processing guarantees rarely make every external business side effect exactly once; design idempotency and reconciliation.

**Never-forget answer:** queues trade synchronous coupling for eventual complexity. Expect duplicates, bound retries, expose age, and make replay a controlled production write path.

## HLD and LLD - the complete design chain

High-level design decides system boundaries, responsibilities, interactions, data authority, topology, quality attributes, and major trade-offs. Low-level design turns those decisions into interfaces, schemas, state machines, algorithms, concurrency rules, failure semantics, instrumentation, and tests.

HLD without LLD can look convincing while hiding impossible contracts. LLD without HLD can produce clean code that solves the wrong boundary or violates a system objective. Every decision below therefore requires a trace from user outcome to production evidence.

| Design level | Primary question | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|
| HLD | What system should exist, why, and under which constraints? | Context, containers, flows, data authority, topology, SLOs, threats, capacity, ADRs, and operations. |
| LLD | Exactly how will each unit behave and remain correct? | Interfaces, schemas, states, algorithms, errors, concurrency, tests, telemetry, and rollout compatibility. |
| Traceability | How does implementation prove the architecture promise? | Requirement IDs, contracts, test IDs, dashboards, runbooks, change evidence, and review decisions. |

### Mandatory diagram set

- HLD diagrams: system context, containers or services, end-to-end sequence, data flow, trust boundaries, deployment topology, failure domains, and multi-region or recovery state where relevant.
- LLD diagrams: component or package view, class or collaboration view where useful, detailed sequence, state machine, schema or entity relationship, concurrency ownership, and rollout or migration state.
- Diagram rule: every box needs a responsibility and owner; every arrow needs a protocol, direction, data, authentication, timeout, retry, and failure meaning where applicable.
- Evidence rule: diagrams are hypotheses until configuration, code, test output, runtime signals, and recovery behavior agree with them.

- HLD source: identify which boundary, quality attribute, invariant, or risk from **Lab** requires this detailed design.
- Connected concern: explain how **Ordering and partitioning** constrains the implementation.
- Contract: write preconditions, inputs, outputs, postconditions, side effects, stable errors, retryability, compatibility, and ownership.
- Model: define types, identity, invariants, lifecycle, state transitions, illegal states, and where each rule is enforced.
- Algorithm: provide pseudocode for the success path, partial failure, cancellation, duplicate work, concurrency conflict, and recovery.
- Persistence: specify keys, constraints, indexes, transaction boundary, isolation, retention, migration, and reconciliation where state exists.
- Concurrency: name shared state, atomic boundary, ordering, lock or version strategy, timeout, fairness, and crash behavior.
- Dependency behavior: define client timeout, retry budget, backoff, circuit or isolation rule, response validation, fallback, and ownership.
- Security behavior: validate input, authenticate principal, authorize action and resource, protect sensitive values, encode output, and audit outcome.
- Instrumentation: define structured outcome event, metric units and labels, trace spans, profile point, correlation key, redaction, and cardinality limit.
- Test design: include examples, boundaries, property or invariant checks, contract cases, integration behavior, race or concurrency tests, load, and faults.
- Failure exercise: overload the system beyond its modeled queueing knee; demonstrate containment, stable error semantics, cleanup, idempotent retry, and final authoritative state.
- Rollout: prove mixed-version compatibility, expand-migrate-contract ordering, feature control, observability, abort condition, and rollback limit.
- Hands-on evidence: produce a capacity, latency, storage, and bandwidth calculation plus interface or schema, pseudocode or implementation sketch, test table, and observed result.
- Code-review gate: behavior is understandable without hidden global state, unsafe defaults, ambiguous errors, unbounded work, or unowned cleanup.
- Interview defense: move from class, interface, schema, or algorithm detail back to the HLD outcome and defend one alternative implementation.

### LLD dimension 47 - Code ownership, documentation, and maintainability

## Visual memory atlas

These diagrams turn the lesson into visual recall cues. Render Mermaid in a compatible Markdown preview, then practice redrawing each diagram without looking.

Use the **memory hook** as the shortest possible reconstruction key. During an interview or incident, draw the main boxes first, add arrows second, and annotate constraints, failure, identity, and evidence last.

### Visual 01 - HLD-to-LLD evidence chain

Memory hook: **WHY - WHERE - HOW - PROOF**.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    R["Requirements and constraints"] --> H["HLD boundaries, flows, data, topology"]
    H --> L["LLD interfaces, schemas, states, algorithms"]
    L --> C["Code and configuration"]
    C --> T["Tests and failure exercises"]
    T --> O["Runtime telemetry and user outcomes"]
    O --> D{"Promise proved?"}
    D -->|"No"| R
    D -->|"Yes"| A["Approved evidence"]
```

How to read it: Requirements explain why; HLD chooses boundaries and topology; LLD defines exact behavior; tests and telemetry prove the promise.

Recall drill: close the diagram, redraw it from the memory hook, label every arrow, then explain one failure and one security concern.

### Visual 02 - Architecture zoom levels

Memory hook: **Context - Containers - Components - Code**.
