# Module 14 — GitOps with Argo CD

## Lesson 16: Observability, Metrics, Notifications & Systematic Troubleshooting

A GitOps control plane can be:

```text
running
```

while failing its purpose.

Examples:

```text
Pods are Ready
but Git fetch is failing

UI loads
but one cluster cache is stale

Application is Synced
but workload is Degraded

notification controller is healthy
but PagerDuty credentials are invalid
```

Therefore Argo observability must answer four questions:

```text
1. Can the control plane serve operators?

2. Can it read and render desired state?

3. Can it observe and reconcile target clusters?

4. Are managed Applications converging and healthy?
```

Argo CD exposes separate Prometheus metrics from its components. Application-controller metrics include Application sync/health information, reconciliation performance, cluster connection state, and cache age; API server, repo-server, ApplicationSet, notification, and other components expose their own endpoints and metrics. ([Argo CD][1])

---

# 14.1786 Observability is not only dashboards

```text
METRICS
→ trends, rates, alerts

LOGS
→ detailed events and errors

KUBERNETES EVENTS
→ resource/controller transitions

ARGO STATUS
→ desired/live/health model

GIT HISTORY
→ declared change and approval

AUDIT LOGS
→ actor and API activity
```

Troubleshooting correlates all six.

---

# 14.1787 Start with service-level symptoms

Do not begin every incident with controller logs.

Start with:

```text
What is the customer/operator impact?

Which Applications or clusters are affected?

When did it begin?

Was there a Git, Argo, cluster, or dependency change?
```

This prevents a noisy log line from becoming a false root cause.

---

# 14.1788 Four observability layers

```text
LAYER 1
Argo component availability

LAYER 2
Git/render pipeline

LAYER 3
cluster observation/reconciliation

LAYER 4
Application sync and health
```

Each layer needs signals and an owner.

---

# 14.1789 Prometheus endpoints

Common service endpoints include:

```text
argocd-metrics:8082/metrics
→ application-controller

argocd-server-metrics:8083/metrics
→ API server

argocd-repo-server metrics service
→ repository/rendering

argocd-applicationset-controller metrics
→ ApplicationSet reconciliation

argocd-notifications-controller metrics
→ notification processing
```

Names and ports should be verified against the installed chart/version. ([Argo CD][1])

---

# 14.1790 Prometheus Operator discovery

If using kube-prometheus-stack, enable the chart's ServiceMonitor resources or define your own.

Conceptual example:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: argocd-application-controller
  namespace: monitoring
spec:
  namespaceSelector:
    matchNames: [argocd]
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: argocd-metrics
  endpoints:
    - port: metrics
      interval: 30s
```

Match the actual Service labels and port name; do not assume this selector fits every chart release.

---

# 14.1791 Prove scraping

Check from Prometheus:

```promql
up{namespace="argocd"}
```

Then query a component metric:

```promql
argocd_app_info
```

If absent:

```text
ServiceMonitor selected?

namespaceSelector correct?

port name correct?

NetworkPolicy allows scrape?

metrics endpoint enabled?

Prometheus RBAC permits discovery?
```

---

# 14.1792 argocd_app_info

`argocd_app_info` is an information gauge carrying labels including Application identity, sync status, and health status. ([Argo CD][1])

Example question:

```promql
count by (sync_status, health_status) (
  argocd_app_info
)
```

This creates a fleet view:

```text
Synced/Healthy

OutOfSync/Healthy

Synced/Degraded

Unknown/*
```

---

# 14.1793 OutOfSync alert

Conceptual Prometheus rule:

```yaml
- alert: ArgoApplicationOutOfSync
  expr: argocd_app_info{sync_status="OutOfSync"} == 1
  for: 15m
  labels:
    severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: "Argo CD Application remains OutOfSync"
```

Tune `for:` by environment and deployment expectations.

An intentional manual-sync production Application may remain OutOfSync while awaiting approval.

---

# 14.1794 Degraded is more urgent

```yaml
- alert: ArgoApplicationDegraded
  expr: argocd_app_info{health_status="Degraded"} == 1
  for: 5m
  labels:
    severity: critical
```

But route by:

```text
environment

service criticality

owner

customer impact
```

not every Application to the same on-call.

---

# 14.1795 Application label metrics

Argo can expose selected Application labels as Prometheus labels.

Useful low-cardinality labels:

```text
team

environment

tier

business-unit
```

Avoid high-cardinality labels such as:

```text
commit SHA

build ID

unique request value
```

Argo warns that every distinct label value creates series and can harm Prometheus performance. ([Argo CD][1])

---

# 14.1796 Cluster connection status

`argocd_cluster_connection_status` indicates current target-cluster connectivity.

Example:

```promql
argocd_cluster_connection_status != 1
```

Before paging, account for:

```text
decommissioned registrations

planned maintenance

temporarily skipped clusters

test clusters
```

Fleet metadata should make routing possible.

---

# 14.1797 Cluster cache age

`argocd_cluster_cache_age_seconds` measures how old the controller's cluster cache is.

High age can mean:

```text
watch disconnected

target API unavailable

controller overloaded

network instability
```

Alert thresholds should reflect normal resync behavior and cluster criticality.

---

# 14.1798 Reconciliation latency

`argocd_app_reconcile` is a histogram of reconciliation duration.

Example percentile:

```promql
histogram_quantile(
  0.95,
  sum by (le) (
    rate(argocd_app_reconcile_bucket[10m])
  )
)
```

Correlate a rise with:

```text
repo render latency

controller CPU/memory

cluster API latency

Git events

Application count
```

---

# 14.1799 Sync activity

`argocd_app_sync_total` counts sync operations by outcome labels available in the installed version.

Use rate/increase expressions to detect changes:

```promql
sum by (phase) (
  increase(argocd_app_sync_total[15m])
)
```

Always inspect actual label names in Prometheus before shipping a rule.

Metric schemas can evolve between Argo releases.

---

# 14.1800 Kubernetes request metrics

Argo exposes Kubernetes client request counts and durations.

These reveal:

```text
429 throttling

5xx target errors

DNS delays

retry storms

large response payloads
```

High request volume from one Application can identify inefficient or non-preferred API usage.

---

# 14.1801 Repository signals

Observe:

```text
Git request count and failures

manifest generation duration

pending render work

repo-server CPU/memory

ephemeral disk

process exits/timeouts
```

Repository failure can affect many Applications sharing one source.

Alert by blast radius, not merely error count.

---

# 14.1802 Redis signals

Observe:

```text
request latency

failed requests

memory usage

evictions

connection failures

HA quorum/failover state
```

A Redis incident may appear as slow UI, rendering cache misses, or controller errors across unrelated Applications.

---

# 14.1803 API server signals

Observe:

```text
request rate

response codes

login failures

gRPC latency where enabled

Ingress latency/errors

Pod availability
```

`argocd_login_request_total` helps reveal login activity and outcomes. Pair it with IdP and reverse-proxy logs for authentication incidents. ([Argo CD][1])

---

# 14.1804 ApplicationSet signals

Observe:

```text
ApplicationSet reconciliation duration

resource update status

number of generated Applications

SCM API errors/rate limits

unexpected create/delete changes
```

One generator failure can affect an entire fleet segment.

---

# 14.1805 Golden control-plane alerts

Minimum starting set:

```text
Argo component unavailable

production Application Degraded

production Application Unknown

unexpected prolonged OutOfSync

cluster connection failed

cluster cache stale

reconciliation p95 too high

sync failure rate increased

repo-server OOM/restart/disk pressure

notification delivery errors

ApplicationSet generation error

Redis quorum/latency problem
```

Every page needs a runbook link.

---

# 14.1806 Avoid alert storms

If Git is unavailable, hundreds of Applications may report errors.

Do not send 500 independent pages.

Use inhibition/grouping:

```text
root dependency alert
→ Git provider unreachable

child symptom alerts
→ grouped or inhibited
```

Likewise group by cluster when one target API fails.

---

# 14.1807 SLO for reconciliation

Example service-level indicator:

```text
time from approved Git commit
to target Application Synced and Healthy
```

It includes:

```text
webhook/poll detection

Git fetch

render

queue wait

sync

Kubernetes rollout health
```

This measures the actual delivery service, not only controller uptime.

---

# 14.1808 Logs by component

```bash
kubectl logs -n argocd deploy/argocd-server

kubectl logs -n argocd statefulset/argocd-application-controller

kubectl logs -n argocd deploy/argocd-repo-server

kubectl logs -n argocd deploy/argocd-applicationset-controller

kubectl logs -n argocd deploy/argocd-notifications-controller
```

Adjust workload kind/name for your installation.

Use `--since`, labels, and centralized logging instead of dumping unlimited logs.

---

# 14.1809 Correlation fields

Capture:

```text
Application name

Application namespace

AppProject

target cluster

Git repository

revision SHA

sync operation ID/time

resource group/kind/name/namespace
```

Argo standardizes several Application log fields, including application, app namespace, and project. ([Argo CD][2])

---

# 14.1810 Kubernetes Events

```bash
kubectl get events -n argocd \
  --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp

kubectl describe application todo-prod -n argocd
```

Events can show:

```text
operation started

resource created

health changed

operation completed
```

Kubernetes Events expire; export them if longer audit retention is required.

---

# 14.1811 Notifications model

```text
SERVICE
= where/how to send

TEMPLATE
= message content

TRIGGER
= when to send

SUBSCRIPTION
= who receives which trigger via which service
```

Argo Notifications monitors Application state and evaluates flexible triggers and templates. ([Argo CD][3])

---

# 14.1812 Notification service

Conceptual Slack service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-notifications-cm
  namespace: argocd
data:
  service.slack: |
    token: $slack-token
```

Token belongs in:

```text
argocd-notifications-secret
```

delivered from the external secret system.

---

# 14.1813 Notification template

```yaml
data:
  template.app-sync-failed: |
    message: |
      Application {{.app.metadata.name}} failed to sync.
      Project: {{.app.spec.project}}
      Revision: {{.app.status.sync.revision}}
      Phase: {{.app.status.operationState.phase}}
      Message: {{.app.status.operationState.message}}
```

Do not include secret values or an uncontrolled full object dump.

Messages should contain a dashboard/runbook link where supported.

---

# 14.1814 Notification trigger

```yaml
data:
  trigger.on-sync-failed: |
    - when: app.status.operationState.phase in ['Error', 'Failed']
      send: [app-sync-failed]
```

Triggers can use `oncePer` to suppress duplicate notifications for the same revision or relevant expression. Design the key carefully so a genuinely new failure is not hidden. ([Argo CD][4])

---

# 14.1815 Application subscription

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    notifications.argoproj.io/subscribe.on-sync-failed.slack: todo-prod-alerts
```

This means:

```text
on-sync-failed
→ Slack
→ todo-prod-alerts
```

Application-level annotations are easy to see in Git.

---

# 14.1816 Project/global subscriptions

Use broader subscriptions for standard policy:

```text
all production sync failures
→ platform on-call

all service health degradations
→ owning team
```

Argo supports subscription definitions in notification configuration and selectors for groups of Applications. ([Argo CD][5])

Avoid two overlapping subscriptions that page the same receiver twice.

---

# 14.1817 Notifications are not alerting replacement

Argo notification:

```text
Application state changed
```

Prometheus alert:

```text
state has violated policy for a duration
```

Use both:

```text
notifications
→ release/event awareness

alerts
→ durable symptom and SLO violation
```

---

# 14.1818 Notification delivery monitoring

Test:

```text
trigger evaluated

template rendered

secret resolved

service endpoint reachable

provider accepted message

correct receiver got it
```

A healthy controller does not prove end-to-end delivery.

Use provider test commands and controller metrics/logs. ([Argo CD][6])

---

# 14.1819 Troubleshooting workflow

Argo CD's troubleshooting guide provides component-specific checks and diagnostic commands; use them inside a repeatable, impact-first workflow. ([Argo CD][7])

```text
1. State the symptom and impact.
2. Scope affected Applications/clusters.
3. Establish the timeline.
4. Inspect Application conditions/status.
5. Compare desired vs live.
6. Identify failing pipeline layer.
7. Inspect component metrics/logs.
8. Verify target Kubernetes resource/events.
9. Change the authoritative cause.
10. Validate convergence and customer behavior.
```

---

# 14.1820 Application first commands

```bash
argocd app get todo-prod --show-operation

argocd app diff todo-prod

argocd app history todo-prod

argocd app resources todo-prod

kubectl get application todo-prod -n argocd -o yaml
```

These establish:

```text
desired revision

sync status

health status

conditions

operation phase

resource tree
```

---

# 14.1821 Refresh vs hard refresh

Normal refresh asks Argo to recompare.

Hard refresh also invalidates relevant cached manifest data and regenerates.

Use hard refresh when evidence points to stale generation/cache—not as the first response to every issue.

```bash
argocd app get todo-prod --refresh

argocd app get todo-prod --hard-refresh
```

Repeated hard refreshes can amplify load.

---

# 14.1822 Compare error

Common causes:

```text
Git unreachable

repository authentication failed

Helm dependency unavailable

Kustomize build failed

plugin error

unknown API/version

manifest generation timeout
```

If desired manifests cannot be generated, Kubernetes debugging is premature.

Inspect repo-server first.

---

# 14.1823 OutOfSync

OutOfSync means desired and live differ.

Ask:

```text
real Git change?

manual drift?

defaulted/mutated field?

another controller owns field?

resource tracking conflict?

normalization issue?
```

Inspect the exact diff before enabling an ignore rule.

---

# 14.1824 Synced but Degraded

```text
desired manifest = live object

live object not operationally healthy
```

Move to workload debugging:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n todo-prod

kubectl describe deployment todo-api -n todo-prod

kubectl get events -n todo-prod --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp

kubectl logs -n todo-prod deploy/todo-api
```

Do not keep pressing Sync.

---

# 14.1825 Progressing too long

Check:

```text
readiness probes

image pull

scheduling

PVC binding

Rollout pause

sync wave health gate

hook Job

custom health definition
```

An intentional canary pause and a stuck Deployment need different action.

---

# 14.1826 Unknown health

Possible causes:

```text
cluster unreachable

resource health unsupported

controller cache stale

custom resource lacks health mapping

permission prevents observation
```

Unknown means insufficient reliable health evidence.

It should not be silently treated as Healthy.

---

# 14.1827 Permission denied

Identify the plane:

```text
Argo API RBAC denied user?

AppProject denied source/destination/kind?

target Kubernetes RBAC denied controller?

AWS IAM denied role assumption?

Git provider denied repository access?
```

The word `permission` is not a root cause.

---

# 14.1828 Target cluster unavailable

Layered test:

```text
destination
→ DNS
→ TCP
→ TLS
→ identity
→ Kubernetes authorization
```

Correlate:

```text
argocd_cluster_connection_status

cluster cache age

application-controller logs

EKS/CloudTrail/network telemetry
```

---

# 14.1829 Hook or wave stuck

Inspect:

```bash
argocd app get todo-prod --show-operation

kubectl get jobs,pods -n todo-prod

kubectl describe job <hook> -n todo-prod

kubectl logs job/<hook> -n todo-prod
```

Find the earliest unhealthy phase/wave.

Later missing resources may be expected.

---

# 14.1830 Notifications missing

Trace:

```text
Application state
→ trigger condition
→ oncePer behavior
→ subscription
→ template
→ secret
→ network
→ provider response
→ receiver
```

Argo provides notification troubleshooting commands to inspect triggers, templates, and sends. ([Argo CD][6])

---

# 14.1831 Safe incident actions

Low-risk diagnostic actions:

```text
read status

inspect diff

query metrics/logs

normal refresh

test permissions
```

Higher-risk actions:

```text
hard refresh fleet-wide

terminate sync

delete finalizer

disable self-heal

change ignore rules

manual live patch

delete controller cache
```

Escalate evidence before mutation.

---

# 14.1832 Troubleshooting evidence packet

Capture before changing state:

```text
UTC timestamps

Application YAML/status

desired Git SHA

Argo version

diff output

operation state

relevant events

component logs

metrics screenshots/query results

target resource status
```

This supports both diagnosis and post-incident learning.

---

# 14.1833 Production observability checklist

```text
□ Every Argo metrics endpoint is scraped

□ Scrape failure alerts exist

□ Production Degraded/Unknown alerts exist

□ OutOfSync alert duration matches policy

□ Cluster connection and cache age are monitored

□ Reconciliation latency SLO exists

□ Repo-server resources and disk are monitored

□ Redis health and latency are monitored

□ ApplicationSet failures are monitored

□ Notification delivery errors are monitored

□ Application ownership labels are low cardinality

□ Alerts route by team/environment/tier

□ Dependency failures are grouped/inhibited

□ Argo logs are centralized

□ Events are exported for required retention

□ Git, audit, and CloudTrail logs correlate by time

□ Notification secrets come from external secret system

□ Templates avoid sensitive content

□ Notification tests run regularly

□ Every page links to a runbook

□ Incident evidence capture is documented
```

---

# 14.1834 Interview — sync vs health monitoring

> **Sync status tells me whether live Kubernetes objects match the desired manifests. Health tells me whether those resources are operational according to Argo's health assessment. I alert on both because an Application can be Synced and Degraded or OutOfSync and still serving traffic.**

---

# 14.1835 Interview — most important Argo metrics

> **I begin with `argocd_app_info` for sync/health fleet state, cluster connection status and cache age for target visibility, reconciliation duration and sync counts for control-loop performance, then component availability and repo-server/Redis/Kubernetes-client signals. The exact alert set is routed by environment and service criticality.** ([Argo CD][1])

---

# 14.1836 Interview — trigger vs template vs subscription

```text
trigger = when

template = what

service = how/where

subscription = who receives which event
```

Concise and correct.

---

# 14.1837 Interview — why is UI green not enough?

> **A green component Pod or available UI proves only part of the path. Git fetch/render, target-cluster cache, reconciliation latency, Application health, and notification delivery can fail independently. I monitor the end-to-end commit-to-healthy outcome.**

---

# 14.1838 Never-forget Lesson 16 rules

```text
1. Running Pods do not prove GitOps works.

2. Observe components, render, clusters, and Applications.

3. Start with impact and scope.

4. Sync and health are independent.

5. Degraded deserves faster attention than routine OutOfSync.

6. Unknown means missing reliable evidence.

7. Cluster cache age reveals stale observation.

8. Reconcile latency is a delivery signal.

9. Verify actual metric labels before writing rules.

10. Use low-cardinality ownership labels.

11. Group dependency-caused alert storms.

12. Measure commit-to-healthy, not only uptime.

13. Logs explain; metrics show behavior over time.

14. Events expire unless exported.

15. Git history is desired-change evidence.

16. Audit logs show operational actors.

17. Trigger means when.

18. Template means content.

19. Subscription means receiver mapping.

20. Notification secret values stay out of Git.

21. Notifications do not replace durable alerting.

22. Healthy controller does not prove message delivery.

23. Compare errors start at Git/rendering.

24. Synced/Degraded starts at workload health.

25. Inspect exact diff before ignoring it.

26. Permission failures have multiple planes.

27. Troubleshoot target connectivity in layers.

28. Find the earliest stuck phase/wave.

29. Capture evidence before risky mutation.

30. Every alert needs an actionable runbook.

# 14.16.1840 Professional Mastery Workbook

This workbook expands **Observability, Metrics, Notifications & Systematic Troubleshooting** into deliberate practice without replacing the authored tutorial above.

Use it after reading the core explanation. The goal is not to memorize thousands of lines; the goal is to repeatedly explain, build, break, secure, observe, recover, and defend the lesson in different conditions.

## Workbook learning contract

- Concepts covered: 54 lesson-specific anchors.
- Progression: beginner, intermediate, expert, professional, industry-ready, certification review, and interview defense.
- Safety: use synthetic data, disposable resources, explicit placeholders, least privilege, and bounded failure experiments.
- Completion: retain commands or configuration, observations, screenshots or query output, decisions, rollback evidence, and a short reflection.
- Quality rule: a passing answer states assumptions, protects a user or business outcome, names ownership, and validates the final result end to end.
- Currency rule: verify current official documentation, versions, limits, pricing, and certification objectives before relying on changing product behavior.

## Seven-stage progression

| Stage | Learner must demonstrate |
|---|---|
| Beginner | Explain the concept in plain language and give one safe example. |
| Intermediate | Connect components, data, control flow, and normal operating behavior. |
| Expert | Analyze trade-offs, edge cases, scaling pressure, and correlated failures. |
| Professional | Make a reviewed decision with owner, evidence, rollout, and rollback. |
| Industry-ready | Operate the design under security, failure, recovery, cost, and compliance constraints. |
| Certification review | Map durable concepts to the latest official objectives without relying on stale wording. |
| Interview defense | Answer concisely, clarify assumptions, draw the model, and defend alternatives. |

## Concept mastery cards

### Concept card 1 - Observability is not only dashboards

- Lesson anchor: METRICS → trends, rates, alerts LOGS → detailed events and errors KUBERNETES EVENTS → resource/controller transitions ARGO STATUS → desired/live/health model GIT HISTORY → declared change and approval AUDIT LOGS → actor and API activity
- Beginner explanation: Restate **Observability is not only dashboards** using a household, workplace, or public-service analogy without hiding the technical truth.

- Plain-language question: What problem does **Observability is not only dashboards** solve here, and who notices first when it fails?
- Lesson evidence anchor: METRICS → trends, rates, alerts LOGS → detailed events and errors KUBERNETES EVENTS → resource/controller transitions ARGO STATUS → desired/live/health model GIT HISTORY → declared change and approval AUDIT LOGS → actor and API activity
- Objective: Preserve a measurable user or business outcome while making the developer experience decision explicit.
- Assumptions to write first: traffic or work volume, data sensitivity, ownership, environment, failure domain, and acceptable risk.
- Diagram task: Mark actors, source of truth, synchronous and asynchronous paths, identity, data, control plane, and recovery boundary.
- Hands-on build: Produce a multi-cluster, RBAC, SSO, secret-delivery, backup, or recovery validation bundle and link it to this practice case ID.
- Safe execution rule: use synthetic data, explicit placeholders, a disposable target, least privilege, and a written abort condition.
- Read-only first check: capture current version, configuration, health, recent changes, workload scope, and the exact user signal.
- Failure injection: break repository authentication, manifest rendering, a required CRD, or destination selection.
- Expected observation: predict one user signal, one component signal, and one control-plane or change signal before running the test.
- Troubleshooting branch: write two competing hypotheses and the cheapest safe check that distinguishes them.
- Security check: test unauthorized access, unsafe input, secret exposure, excessive privilege, and audit evidence where relevant.
- Reliability check: test timeout, retry, partial success, duplicate work, degraded mode, and recovery within the stated objective.
- Performance and cost check: record demand, latency or queueing, capacity, amplification, paid resources, and one useful unit.
- Rollback or containment: identify the smallest reversible action, its authority, expected result, risk, and stop condition.
- Recovery proof: validate the original user journey, authoritative state, backlog, telemetry, desired-state convergence, and side effects.
- Evidence package: save sanitized configuration or command, query output, UTC timeline, decision, result, and unresolved risk.
- Certification checkpoint: Map the evidence to current Argo CD, GitOps, Kubernetes, CNCF, or cloud certification objectives, and verify changing behavior in official documentation.
- Interview prompt: Defend **Observability is not only dashboards** against an alternative while protecting developer experience under this scenario.
- Strong-answer outline: clarify requirements; draw the mechanism; quantify scale; cover security and failure; choose; validate; state limitation.
- Common mistake to avoid: naming a tool, replica count, dashboard, or discount as proof without demonstrating the end-to-end outcome.
- Completion rule: another learner can reproduce the safe test, explain the evidence, and reach the same conclusion without private coaching.

## Workbook completion review

- Practice cases generated for this lesson: 55.
- Select at least one case at every learning level and one case for every concept card.
- Complete at least one controlled failure, one security review, one recovery proof, one cost or capacity analysis, and one oral defense.
- Revisit any case where the result depended on an unstated assumption, unverified documentation, unsafe access, or a dashboard without authoritative evidence.
- The workbook is complete only when explanations remain correct in plain language and decisions remain defensible under realistic production constraints.
