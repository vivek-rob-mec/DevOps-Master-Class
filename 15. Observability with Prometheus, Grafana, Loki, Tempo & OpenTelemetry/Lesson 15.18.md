# Module 15 — Observability

## Lesson 18: Production Observability Capstone

# 15.18.1 Mission

Build an observable `todo` service on Kubernetes:

```text
client → ingress → todo-api → PostgreSQL
                    └──────► queue → worker
```

Deploy Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana, Loki, Tempo, and OpenTelemetry Collectors. All changes are Git-managed and version-pinned.

# 15.18.2 Acceptance criteria

```text
METRICS
RED metrics, dependency metrics, business outcome, resource saturation

LOGS
structured JSON, trace correlation, redaction, retention

TRACES
HTTP + DB + queue propagation, safe attributes, sampling policy

DASHBOARDS
fleet, service, SLO, Kubernetes, telemetry pipeline

ALERTS
SLO burn, traffic-aware availability, imminent exhaustion, pipeline failure

OPERATIONS
owners, runbooks, backup, upgrade, capacity and cost model
```

# 15.18.3 Repository design

```text
observability/
├── helm-values/
├── collectors/
├── dashboards/
├── rules/
├── alerts/
├── tests/
├── runbooks/
└── architecture/
```

CI validates YAML, Collector configuration, rule syntax/tests, dashboard JSON, policy, and forbidden secret patterns.

# 15.18.4 Required failure experiments

1. Application returns controlled 5xx errors.
2. Database becomes slow.
3. Metrics endpoint stops.
4. Log backend rejects traffic.
5. Trace exporter is unavailable.
6. Collector restarts under load.
7. Notification receiver rejects credentials.
8. One node or Availability Zone is removed.

For each, capture detection time, alert, dashboard, correlated evidence, response, recovery validation, data loss, and improvement.

# 15.18.5 Security review

Prove no static cloud keys, no public ingestion endpoints, least-privilege access, encrypted transport/storage, secret redaction, tenant isolation, controlled plugins, auditability, and deletion/retention policy.

# 15.18.6 Definition of done

```text
□ A responder starts from one page and finds root cause evidence
□ Alerts carry owner, urgency, dashboard, and runbook
□ Metrics/log/trace correlation works
□ Cardinality and ingestion budgets are enforced
□ Telemetry failures are themselves detected
□ Restore and upgrade are rehearsed
□ Cost per service/environment is reported
□ Architecture and tradeoffs are documented
```

Deliver a ten-minute demo: release change, observe it, inject failure, receive alert, pivot across signals, recover, and confirm the user SLI.

# 15.18.7 What this capstone proves

The capstone is not “install six tools.” It proves that you can turn an unknown production symptom into a safe decision:

```text
detect -> page -> scope -> correlate -> diagnose -> mitigate
       -> verify recovery -> learn -> prevent recurrence
```

Every acceptance criterion must have reproducible evidence, an owner, and a negative test. A screenshot of a dashboard is evidence that a page rendered—not that collection, alerting, correlation, or recovery works.

# 15.18.8 Target application behavior

Build or reuse a small application with enough real boundaries to teach observability:

```text
POST /todos
  -> validate request
  -> insert todo in PostgreSQL
  -> publish todo-created message
  -> return authoritative API outcome

worker
  -> consume message
  -> perform simulated enrichment
  -> update PostgreSQL
  -> retry and dead-letter after policy
```

Include controlled feature flags or lab-only endpoints to inject latency, HTTP failure, database timeout, malformed log, and worker retry. These controls must be disabled or strongly protected outside the lab.

# 15.18.9 Repository structure and ownership

Expand the repository so intent and generated state remain clear:

```text

├── README.md
├── architecture/
│   ├── context.md
│   ├── data-flow.md
│   ├── threat-model.md

│   ├── smoke/
│   └── failure/
├── runbooks/
└── evidence/
```

Keep secrets out of Git. Store templates/references to the secret delivery mechanism and use workload identity for cloud access.

# 15.18.10 Phase 1: write objectives before deploying tools

Define example service objectives:

```text
Availability SLI:
  successful authoritative creates / valid create attempts

Latency SLI:
  valid create attempts completed within 300 ms / valid attempts

Worker freshness SLI:
  messages processed within 60 s / eligible messages
```

Specify window, target, exclusions, source, owner, and missing-data behavior. Then define observability-platform objectives for collection freshness, critical-query availability, rule evaluation, and page delivery.

# 15.18.11 Phase 2: instrument the applications

Required telemetry contract:

```text
RESOURCE
service.name, service.version, deployment.environment.name

METRICS
HTTP RED, dependency duration/result, queue depth/age,
worker attempts/results, authoritative todo completion

TRACES
HTTP server/client, database, message producer/consumer,
one meaningful business span, correct propagation

LOGS
one structured completion/error event, result, duration,
safe error type, trace_id/span_id, service version
```

Add tests for retry double-counting, raw-route cardinality, synthetic secret leakage, asynchronous context, and graceful shutdown.

# 15.18.12 Phase 3: deploy collection and storage

Implement in controlled increments:

1. Prometheus discovers application and Kubernetes targets.
2. OpenTelemetry agents/gateways receive OTLP and relevant logs.
3. Loki accepts bounded streams and structured content.
4. Tempo stores complete cross-service traces.
5. Grafana data sources are provisioned by stable UID.
6. Alertmanager has a synthetic test receiver.

At every step, validate configuration, health, accepted/sent/rejected counters, and one end-to-end canary before adding the next dependency.

# 15.18.13 Phase 4: build dashboards as decision interfaces

Create these dashboards:

| Dashboard | Questions it must answer |
|---|---|
| Fleet | Which clusters/namespaces/services are unhealthy? |
| Service | Are users failing; which route/version/dependency? |
| SLO | Current compliance, burn rate, remaining budget? |
| Kubernetes | Is scheduling/resource/runtime state causal? |
| Pipeline | Is telemetry delayed, rejected, queued, or dropped? |
| Delivery | Which digest/revision is synced, healthy, and serving? |

Every dashboard includes owner, purpose, links, units, time behavior, and a no-data policy. Provision dashboards from Git and test important queries directly against the data sources.

# 15.18.14 Phase 5: implement tested alerts

Required alert classes:

```text
fast and slow SLO burn
sustained traffic-aware failure ratio
latency objective breach
queue-age/freshness breach
imminent disk/queue/capacity exhaustion
Prometheus target/rule failure affecting coverage
Collector rejected/dropped/backlog condition
log/trace ingestion canary missing
notification delivery canary failure
```

Each alert has owner, severity, user impact, dashboard, runbook, and meaningful summary. Add `promtool` unit tests for Prometheus rules and controlled delivery tests for routing/inhibition.

# 15.18.15 Phase 6: complete cross-signal correlation

Prove all of these arrows:

```text
SLO alert -> service dashboard
histogram exemplar -> Tempo trace
trace -> Loki logs
Loki trace_id -> Tempo
service version -> deployment annotation
annotation -> config revision and artifact digest
alert -> owner and runbook
```

Repeat the proof after a new deployment. A hard-coded lab namespace or data-source UID often breaks when promoted.

# 15.18.16 Phase 7: production security review

Create a threat model covering workloads, collectors, gateways, storage, Grafana, alert receivers, object storage, GitOps, and administrators. Evidence must demonstrate:

- ingestion endpoints are private or strongly authenticated;
- source/tenant identity cannot be freely spoofed;
- transport uses approved encryption outside isolated labs;
- backend/cloud access uses least privilege and short-lived identity;
- logs/traces exclude synthetic forbidden fields after processing;
- SSO/RBAC separates viewers, editors, and administrators;
- dashboards/plugins/images/configuration follow supply-chain controls;
- retention, deletion, legal hold, and access audit are defined;
- debug endpoints/exporters are absent from production.

# 15.18.17 Phase 8: capacity and cost model

Calculate expected and 2× peak:

```text
metric active series and samples/s
log streams, bytes/s, and retained bytes
trace requests/s, spans/trace, sampled spans/s, retained bytes
collector queue needed for outage target
query concurrency and maximum lookback
object-store capacity/requests and network transfer
cost allocation by service/team/environment
```

Run a representative load test and replace assumptions with observations. Identify the top three telemetry cost sources and justify whether each is valuable.

# 15.18.18 Failure experiment procedure

Use one worksheet per experiment:

```markdown
## Hypothesis and safety boundary
## Expected user and telemetry impact
## Abort conditions
## Injection method
## Detection and alert timestamps
## Metric/log/trace evidence
## Mitigation
## SLI recovery proof
## Data loss/duplicate assessment
## Actual versus expected
## Improvement and owner/date
```

Run in staging first. Production experiments need explicit change approval, bounded blast radius, rollback, and on-call coordination.

# 15.18.19 Experiment A: database latency

Inject a controlled database delay. Expected investigation:

```text
latency SLI/burn changes
-> service histogram shows affected route/version
-> exemplar opens slow trace
-> database child span dominates critical path
-> structured log classifies dependency timeout
-> runbook applies safe mitigation
-> original SLI returns within objective
```

Verify HTTP timeout/cancellation, connection-pool saturation, retry behavior, and whether worker/API impact differs.

# 15.18.20 Experiment B: telemetry backend outage

Block Loki or Tempo export for a bounded interval. The application should continue within its performance objective while the telemetry pipeline shows retries/queue growth. Restore the backend and measure backlog drain, duplicates, loss, and end-to-end delay.

This test distinguishes application resilience from observability durability. State the accepted data-loss boundary rather than claiming perfect delivery.

# 15.18.21 Experiment C: cardinality regression

In an isolated stack, introduce raw todo IDs into a metric label or Loki label. Detect growth using cardinality/stream monitoring and backend limits. Remove the unsafe dimension at instrumentation/schema source and add a CI/policy test.

Do not solve it only by buying more capacity or increasing limits.

# 15.18.22 Experiment D: missed notification

Use a synthetic receiver with an invalid lab credential. Follow:

```text
rule firing -> Prometheus send -> Alertmanager route
-> receiver attempt -> provider rejection -> delivery alert
```

Restore the credential through the approved secret mechanism, reload safely, and prove receipt. Document fallback communication if the primary provider fails.

# 15.18.23 Experiment E: node or zone loss

Remove a node in a disposable cluster, then model or safely test a zone failure. Validate not only pod rescheduling but:

```text
scrape continuity and gaps
collector checkpoints/queues
Prometheus rule continuity
Alertmanager notification behavior
Loki/Tempo ingestion and stored data
Grafana query degradation
customer SLI
actual recovery time
```

# 15.18.24 Backup, restore, and upgrade rehearsal

Restore into an isolated environment:

- Git-managed dashboards/rules/Collector/backends configuration;
- required secrets and identity references through approved recovery;
- representative historical telemetry or object-store access;
- alert routing without contacting real receivers;
- known queries, cross-links, and a synthetic rule.

Then canary one component upgrade, watching schema compatibility, accepted/rejected data, historical queries, dashboards, alerts, and rollback. Record actual RPO/RTO.

# 15.18.25 CI quality gates

Implement commands or jobs appropriate to the repository:

```text
YAML/JSON/schema validation
promtool check config/rules and rule unit tests
Collector configuration validation with pinned binary/image
Kubernetes/Helm/Kustomize rendering validation
policy checks for privileged workloads/public endpoints
secret and forbidden telemetry-field scanning
dashboard query smoke tests
ephemeral end-to-end telemetry canary
```

CI should explain the broken contract, not only return “failed.” Keep production credentials out of tests.

# 15.18.26 Operational handoff

For every service and platform component, document owner, escalation, dashboard, alert, runbook, dependencies, normal ranges, capacity limits, backup, upgrade, and decommission process. Hold a game day with someone who did not build the system; their confusion exposes missing operational knowledge.

# 15.18.27 Certification completion tutorial

Use the capstone as a practical bridge for Prometheus and OpenTelemetry certification preparation:

```text
Prometheus concepts -> targets, labels, PromQL, rules, alerting, exporters
OpenTelemetry       -> API/SDK, resources, traces/metrics/logs, OTLP, Collector
Kubernetes          -> workloads, discovery, RBAC, scheduling, debugging
SRE                 -> SLI/SLO, alert quality, incidents, capacity, reliability
```

Certification versions and weights change. Compare the latest official objectives, mark each objective with an artifact or lab proof, revisit weak areas, and take a timed mock assessment only after you can rebuild the core lab without step-by-step copying.

# 15.18.28 Portfolio and assessment rubric

Score each area from 0 to 3:

```text
0 absent
1 works in happy path
2 tested under failure and documented
3 production tradeoffs, security, automation, and measured recovery
```

Assess instrumentation, metrics/PromQL, logs/LogQL, traces/propagation, correlation, alerts, dashboards, security, capacity/cost, HA/DR, GitOps/CI, incident execution, and documentation. A portfolio-ready capstone should have no zero and should explain why some areas are not yet level 3.

# 15.18.29 Interview presentation: ten-minute structure

```text
Minute 0–1: problem, user journey, and objectives
Minute 1–3: architecture, identity, and signal contracts
Minute 3–5: dashboard, alert, and correlation demo
Minute 5–7: one failure experiment and evidence
Minute 7–8: security and tenancy
Minute 8–9: capacity, HA, and DR
Minute 9–10: tradeoffs, lessons, and next improvement
```

Do not spend the interview listing installed tools. Explain decisions, failure boundaries, measurements, and what you would change at 10× scale.

# 15.18.30 Capstone interview questions

**Why did you choose each signal?**  Tie it to a user/operator question and explain cost/privacy/cardinality.

**How do you know alerts work?**  Rule unit tests plus a synthetic end-to-end route/delivery test and monitored canary.

**What happens when the Collector backend is down?**  Explain bounded queues, retries, source retention, application isolation, loss boundary, recovery throughput, and alerts with measured results.

**How do you prevent telemetry from leaking secrets?**  Source minimization, structured allowlists/redaction, pipeline defense-in-depth, access control, retention, and synthetic leakage tests.

**What is your largest scaling risk?**  Use measured active series/streams/spans/query data; do not guess.

**How do you prove a deployment caused an incident?**  Correlate SLI onset with immutable version/digest/revision and affected traces/logs, then validate recovery after authoritative revert.

**What would fail during a regional outage?**  Describe local alerting/queues, regional storage/query, global routing, notification dependencies, RPO/RTO, and tested versus assumed behavior.

**Never-forget answer:** the capstone is done when another responder can detect, explain, and recover a controlled failure from evidence—and the system proves its own telemetry, security, capacity, and recovery promises.

# 15.18.31 Professional Mastery Workbook

This workbook expands **Production Observability Capstone** into deliberate practice without replacing the authored tutorial above.

Use it after reading the core explanation. The goal is not to memorize thousands of lines; the goal is to repeatedly explain, build, break, secure, observe, recover, and defend the lesson in different conditions.

## Workbook learning contract

- Concepts covered: 30 lesson-specific anchors.
- Progression: beginner, intermediate, expert, professional, industry-ready, certification review, and interview defense.
- Safety: use synthetic data, disposable resources, explicit placeholders, least privilege, and bounded failure experiments.
- Completion: retain commands or configuration, observations, screenshots or query output, decisions, rollback evidence, and a short reflection.
- Quality rule: a passing answer states assumptions, protects a user or business outcome, names ownership, and validates the final result end to end.
- Currency rule: verify current official documentation, versions, limits, pricing, and certification objectives before relying on changing product behavior.

## Seven-stage progression

| Stage | Learner must demonstrate |
|---|---|
| Beginner | Explain the concept in plain language and give one safe example. |
| Intermediate | Connect components, data, control flow, and normal operating behavior. |
| Expert | Analyze trade-offs, edge cases, scaling pressure, and correlated failures. |
| Professional | Make a reviewed decision with owner, evidence, rollout, and rollback. |
| Industry-ready | Operate the design under security, failure, recovery, cost, and compliance constraints. |
| Certification review | Map durable concepts to the latest official objectives without relying on stale wording. |
| Interview defense | Answer concisely, clarify assumptions, draw the model, and defend alternatives. |

### Practice case 104 - Phase 5: implement tested alerts x delivery safety

- Learning level: Certification review.
- Environment: a security and audit review.
- Scenario: The team must apply **Phase 5: implement tested alerts** while a change involving **Security review** places **delivery safety** at risk.
- Plain-language question: What problem does **Phase 5: implement tested alerts** solve here, and who notices first when it fails?
- Lesson evidence anchor: Required alert classes: fast and slow SLO burn sustained traffic-aware failure ratio latency objective breach queue-age/freshness breach imminent disk/queue/capacity exhaustion Prometheus target/rule failure affecting coverage
- Objective: Preserve a measurable user or business outcome while making the delivery safety decision explicit.
- Assumptions to write first: traffic or work volume, data sensitivity, ownership, environment, failure domain, and acceptable risk.

- Expected observation: predict one user signal, one component signal, and one control-plane or change signal before running the test.
- Troubleshooting branch: write two competing hypotheses and the cheapest safe check that distinguishes them.

- Reliability check: test timeout, retry, partial success, duplicate work, degraded mode, and recovery within the stated objective.
- Performance and cost check: record demand, latency or queueing, capacity, amplification, paid resources, and one useful unit.
- Rollback or containment: identify the smallest reversible action, its authority, expected result, risk, and stop condition.
- Recovery proof: validate the original user journey, authoritative state, backlog, telemetry, desired-state convergence, and side effects.
- Evidence package: save sanitized configuration or command, query output, UTC timeline, decision, result, and unresolved risk.
- Certification checkpoint: Map the result to the current Prometheus or OpenTelemetry objectives and state which behavior was proved.
- Interview prompt: Defend **Phase 5: implement tested alerts** against an alternative while protecting delivery safety under this scenario.
- Strong-answer outline: clarify requirements; draw the mechanism; quantify scale; cover security and failure; choose; validate; state limitation.
- Common mistake to avoid: naming a tool, replica count, dashboard, or discount as proof without demonstrating the end-to-end outcome.
- Completion rule: another learner can reproduce the safe test, explain the evidence, and reach the same conclusion without private coaching.
