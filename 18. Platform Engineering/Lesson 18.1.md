# Module 18 — Platform Engineering

## Lesson 1: Platform Engineering Mental Model

Platform engineering builds and operates reusable capabilities that let product teams deliver safely with less cognitive load. The platform is a product; developers and operators are its users.

# 18.1.1 Platform value loop

```text
developer need
→ self-service interface/golden path
→ reusable automation and controls
→ application delivery outcome
→ usage, reliability, feedback, cost
→ platform improvement
```

A platform is not merely a Kubernetes cluster, portal, or collection of scripts. It includes interfaces, workflows, documentation, support, reliability, governance, and a product roadmap.

# 18.1.2 Control plane and interfaces

```text
portal / CLI / API / Git
          ↓
platform orchestration and policy
          ↓
CI, registry, IaC, GitOps, secrets, Kubernetes, observability
          ↓
cloud and managed services
```

Provide more than one interface where it helps: a portal for discovery, CLI/API for automation, and Git for review/audit. They should call the same versioned capabilities.

# 18.1.3 Paved road, not prison

A golden path is the easiest supported route for common workloads. It packages good defaults and production evidence. Teams can request exceptions through a documented, time-bounded process. If most teams bypass the path, investigate the platform—not only the teams.

# 18.1.4 Platform boundaries

Define ownership between:

```text
cloud foundation team
platform team
security team
data platform
service/product team
SRE/on-call
```

The platform should not silently own application business logic or production outcomes. Service teams own their code, SLOs, data, and operational readiness; the platform owns the reliability and usability of shared capabilities.

# 18.1.5 Lab

Interview three hypothetical developer personas. Map their journey from new service to production. Identify wait states, handoffs, repeated decisions, failure risks, and toil. Propose one platform capability with measurable outcome.

# 18.1.6 Interview answer

> **Platform engineering creates a product of reusable, reliable self-service capabilities that reduces developer cognitive load while embedding safe defaults. I begin with user journeys, offer versioned interfaces and golden paths, preserve escape hatches with governance, define ownership, and measure adoption, lead time, success, reliability, support load, and user satisfaction.**

# 18.1.7 Beginner mental model: build a road system, not one taxi ride

If every traveler must design a road before reaching work, movement is slow and unsafe. A platform provides maintained roads, signs, guardrails, and destinations. Teams still choose where to go and can request another route when the paved road does not fit.

```text
developer intent -> platform interface -> automated workflow
-> cloud/Kubernetes/GitOps/CI/observability capabilities
-> operable production service
```

Platform engineering improves how teams use infrastructure and delivery systems; it does not remove service ownership from developers.

# 18.1.8 Platform versus portal, tools, and infrastructure

```text
portal: one possible user interface
platform: capabilities + interfaces + workflows + operations
infrastructure: compute/network/storage foundations
toolchain: individual products integrated by the platform
```

Installing Backstage does not automatically create a platform. A CLI or API can provide excellent platform experience without a portal if it solves the journey reliably.

# 18.1.9 Internal developer platform capabilities

A mature platform may offer:

```text
service creation and catalog ownership
source repositories and reusable CI
artifact provenance and promotion
runtime environments and GitOps delivery
databases/queues/caches as governed resources
identity, secrets, policy, and network baselines
metrics/logs/traces/SLO onboarding
cost/usage visibility
day-2 upgrade, recovery, and decommission workflows
```

Start with the highest-friction repeated journey. Do not launch all capabilities at once.

# 18.1.10 Platform product boundaries

Draw responsibility:

| Outcome | Platform | Application team |
|---|---|---|
| Kubernetes cluster baseline | owns | consumes contract |
| App code/business correctness | enables templates | owns |
| Reusable delivery workflow | owns interface/defaults | supplies tests/config |
| Production SLO | supplies tooling | owns user objective |
| Runtime incident | platform handles platform cause | service owner handles service cause |
| Exceptions | evaluates/enables safe path | justifies and owns residual risk |

Unclear shared responsibility becomes incident delay and ticket ping-pong.

# 18.1.11 Control plane, data plane, and management plane

For a platform:

```text
experience/interface plane: portal, CLI, API, docs
orchestration/control plane: workflows/controllers/catalog/policy
resource/data plane: clusters, apps, databases, queues
management plane: identity, audit, telemetry, billing, operations
```

Control-plane failure should not unnecessarily stop stable applications. Design repair, source of truth, and bounded emergency access.

# 18.1.12 Declarative intent and reconciliation

Prefer durable user intent:

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.example.io/v1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: todo-api
spec:
  owner: team-todo
  runtime: kubernetes
  environmentClass: production-standard
  databaseClass: postgres-ha-small
  observabilityProfile: tier1
```

Controllers/workflows translate this into resources and report status. The schema is a product API: version it, validate it, preserve compatibility, and expose failures clearly.

# 18.1.13 Golden path and escape hatch

A golden path is the easiest supported route for common needs. It should provide safe defaults and reduce choices, while an exception process supports legitimate uncommon requirements.

```text
golden path -> fast, automated, supported, documented
extension    -> supported configurable boundary
exception    -> reviewed risk, owner, expiry, migration plan
unsupported  -> team owns more lifecycle burden explicitly
```

If teams constantly bypass the path, investigate product fit rather than adding punishment.

# 18.1.14 Platform as product loop

```text
discover friction -> select outcome -> prototype with users
-> measure journey -> release/adopt -> operate/support
-> learn -> improve or retire
```

Interview developers, observe real workflow, and use tickets/incidents/lead-time data. Avoid building only from platform-team preferences.

# 18.1.15 Measure outcomes, not portal clicks

Useful measures include:

```text
time from request to first production-ready service
time to create/restore an environment
deployment lead time and failure/recovery
percentage using supported paths
manual tickets and handoffs removed
security/ownership/telemetry readiness at creation
developer satisfaction and task success
platform SLO and support load
```

Adoption alone can be coerced. Pair it with success, reliability, and user feedback.

# 18.1.16 Real hands-on: platform opportunity map

Choose three teams and map one service journey:

```text
idea -> repository -> pipeline -> environment -> deployment
-> observability -> on-call -> change -> recovery -> deletion
```

Record waiting time, manual steps, permissions, errors, repeated decisions, ownership, risk, and tool switching. Select one problem with high frequency/impact and a measurable desired outcome.

# 18.1.17 Platform capability canvas

```markdown
Capability: Production service bootstrap
Users/personas: application engineer, team lead, security reviewer
Problem: 12 tickets and 10 days to become production-ready
Outcome: safe first deployment in under 1 day
Interface: template + declarative application API
Defaults: CI, GitOps, SLO starter, ownership, policy
Boundaries: supported languages/runtimes
SLO/owner: platform bootstrap team
Adoption/migration: pilot 3 teams, migration assistant
Risks: template drift, privilege, unused repositories
Evidence: completion rate, lead time, readiness score, support tickets
```

# 18.1.18 Failure exercise: platform unavailable

Make the portal or orchestration workflow unavailable in a lab. Determine:

```text
Do running applications continue?
Can teams deploy/rollback urgent changes?
Is intent safely queued or rejected?
Can operators diagnose without the portal?
How is reconciliation resumed without duplication?
```

Define platform SLOs per capability instead of one meaningless “platform uptime.”

# 18.1.19 Anti-patterns

- Portal-first project without user discovery.
- Central team becomes ticket bottleneck.
- One template copied forever with no upgrades.
- Mandatory road with no exception/feedback.
- Hiding cloud/Kubernetes reality so thoroughly that incidents are impossible to debug.
- Measuring lines of platform code or number of tools.
- Platform owns every application problem.
- Self-service grants broad credentials or unbounded resources.

# 18.1.20 Certification and interview preparation

Platform engineering certifications and curricula evolve; compare this module with the current official CNCF/Linux Foundation or cloud provider objectives you choose. Focus on durable capabilities, not a portal brand.

**Beginner: What is platform engineering?**  Treating shared internal capabilities as a product so developers can safely deliver and operate software with lower cognitive load.

**Intermediate: Platform versus portal?**  A portal is an interface; the platform includes APIs, workflows, policies, resources, operations, and support behind it.

**Intermediate: What is a golden path?**  A supported, automated route with safe defaults for a common journey, plus clear extension/exception boundaries.

**Senior: What should developers still own?**  Application/business correctness, service objectives, safe configuration, and production outcomes under the shared-responsibility contract.

**Senior: How do you pick the first capability?**  User research plus frequency, delay, risk, repeated work, feasibility, and measurable outcome.

**Expert: How do you avoid platform lock-in?**  Stable provider-neutral intent where useful, documented contracts, export/migration paths, replaceable integrations, and honest provider-specific capabilities.

**Architect: How do you prove platform value?**  Task success/lead time, reliability/security readiness, support/toil reduction, adoption/retention, and developer outcomes tied to business delivery.

**Never-forget answer:** a platform is a product of reusable capabilities and contracts. Start with developer pain, provide a safe paved road, measure the journey, and keep ownership explicit.

# 18.1.21 Professional Mastery Workbook

This workbook expands **Platform Engineering Mental Model** into deliberate practice without replacing the authored tutorial above.

Use it after reading the core explanation. The goal is not to memorize thousands of lines; the goal is to repeatedly explain, build, break, secure, observe, recover, and defend the lesson in different conditions.

## Workbook learning contract

- Concepts covered: 20 lesson-specific anchors.
- Progression: beginner, intermediate, expert, professional, industry-ready, certification review, and interview defense.
- Safety: use synthetic data, disposable resources, explicit placeholders, least privilege, and bounded failure experiments.
- Completion: retain commands or configuration, observations, screenshots or query output, decisions, rollback evidence, and a short reflection.
- Quality rule: a passing answer states assumptions, protects a user or business outcome, names ownership, and validates the final result end to end.
- Currency rule: verify current official documentation, versions, limits, pricing, and certification objectives before relying on changing product behavior.

## Seven-stage progression

| Stage | Learner must demonstrate |
|---|---|
| Beginner | Explain the concept in plain language and give one safe example. |
| Intermediate | Connect components, data, control flow, and normal operating behavior. |
| Expert | Analyze trade-offs, edge cases, scaling pressure, and correlated failures. |
| Professional | Make a reviewed decision with owner, evidence, rollout, and rollback. |
| Industry-ready | Operate the design under security, failure, recovery, cost, and compliance constraints. |
| Certification review | Map durable concepts to the latest official objectives without relying on stale wording. |
| Interview defense | Answer concisely, clarify assumptions, draw the model, and defend alternatives. |
