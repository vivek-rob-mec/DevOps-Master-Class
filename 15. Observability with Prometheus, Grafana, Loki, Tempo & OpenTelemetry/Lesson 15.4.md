# Module 15 — Observability

## Lesson 4: Kubernetes and EKS Monitoring

# 15.4.1 Four monitoring layers

```text
cloud/EKS control plane → API, audit, authenticator, scheduler/controller signals
cluster                 → nodes, API server, scheduler, DNS, CNI, storage
workload                → desired/available replicas, restarts, resources
service/user            → requests, errors, duration, business outcomes
```

`kube-state-metrics` reports the state stored in Kubernetes objects. Node exporters report host metrics. Kubelet/cAdvisor endpoints report container resource activity. Application instrumentation reports service behavior. These are complementary, not interchangeable.

# 15.4.2 High-value queries

```promql
# pods restarting
sum by (namespace, pod) (increase(kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total[15m]))

# deployment unavailable
kube_deployment_status_replicas_unavailable > 0

# CPU usage vs requested cores
sum by (namespace, pod) (rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container!=""}[5m]))
/
sum by (namespace, pod) (kube_pod_container_resource_requests{resource="cpu"})

# node filesystem pressure — adapt labels to exporter version
1 - (
  node_filesystem_avail_bytes{fstype!~"tmpfs|overlay"}
  / node_filesystem_size_bytes{fstype!~"tmpfs|overlay"}
)
```

# 15.4.3 EKS considerations

Enable only the control-plane log categories needed by policy and investigation, route them with defined retention, and protect audit data. Monitor VPC CNI address pressure, CoreDNS, load balancer health, EBS/EFS behavior, node lifecycle, and AWS API throttling. Join cloud dimensions to cluster metadata carefully; account, region, cluster, namespace, and workload should be consistently named.

# 15.4.4 Lab — golden Kubernetes dashboard

Create one dashboard with:

```text
cluster/node readiness
unschedulable pods
namespace CPU/memory requests, limits, and usage
workload desired vs available replicas
container restarts and OOM kills
API request errors/latency
CoreDNS errors/latency
PVC usage and storage errors
```

Run a controlled failure: deploy a Pod with an impossible node selector, then use Events and metrics to prove scheduling—not image pull or readiness—is the failing layer.

# 15.4.5 Security and cost

Do not scrape privileged endpoints through public networks. Scope bearer tokens and TLS trust. Drop unused high-cardinality metrics at collection time only after proving they are not required. Preserve enough granularity for accountability and incidents.

# Beginner Level

# 15.4.6 Kubernetes observability in layman language

Think of Kubernetes as a city:

```text
control plane → city administration
nodes         → buildings
Pods          → offices
containers    → workers
Services      → internal phone directory
Ingress/LB    → city entrance
storage       → warehouses
network       → roads
```

If one customer request fails, the problem may be:

```text
application code
Pod readiness
Service selector
node pressure
DNS
CNI/IP exhaustion
load balancer
storage
control plane
external AWS dependency
```

Therefore Kubernetes monitoring must cover layers, not merely Pod CPU.

---

# 15.4.7 What each data source tells you

## kube-state-metrics

Reads Kubernetes API objects and exposes their declared/current status.

Examples:

```text
Deployment desired vs available replicas
Pod phase and container status
resource requests and limits
PVC status
Job completion
HPA desired/current replicas
```

It does not measure actual container CPU usage.

## Kubelet and container metrics

Provide actual container and node runtime resource activity such as CPU and memory, depending on endpoint and configuration.

## node_exporter

Provides Linux node operating-system/hardware metrics:

```text
CPU
memory
filesystem
network
load
```

## Kubernetes component metrics

API server, scheduler, controller manager, etcd where applicable, CoreDNS, ingress and add-ons expose control-plane/platform behavior.

## Application metrics

Tell whether users and business operations succeed.

No one source replaces the others.

---

# 15.4.8 Desired state vs real usage

Example:

```text
Deployment desired replicas = 5
available replicas          = 3
```

This is state evidence.

Example:

```text
Pod CPU request = 500m
actual CPU use  = 80m
```

This compares configuration with usage.

Example:

```text
All 5 replicas available
checkout error ratio = 12%
```

Kubernetes is satisfying desired replica state, but the application is unreliable.

Always connect infrastructure and user telemetry.

---

# Intermediate Level

# 15.4.9 Cluster monitoring hierarchy

```text
Fleet
→ clusters connected and telemetry fresh

Cluster
→ control plane, nodes, DNS, network, storage

Namespace/team
→ quotas, requests, usage, failures

Workload
→ desired/available replicas, rollout, restarts

Pod/container
→ scheduling, readiness, CPU, memory, OOM, logs

Service/user
→ traffic, errors, latency, correctness
```

A fleet dashboard should lead to a cluster view, then workload view, then correlated logs/traces. Do not force responders to search unrelated dashboards manually.

---

# 15.4.10 Scheduling evidence

An unscheduled Pod can be caused by:

```text
insufficient requested CPU/memory
node selector/affinity mismatch
taint without toleration
unbound PVC
topology constraint
quota
maximum Pod/IP capacity
```

Evidence:

```bash
kubectl get pods -A --field-selector=status.phase=Pending
kubectl describe pod POD -n NAMESPACE
kubectl get events -A --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
```

Metrics can show scope and trend, while Events and `describe` show the current scheduling decision.

---

# 15.4.11 Restart and OOM evidence

Restart count alone does not identify cause.

Inspect:

```bash
kubectl get pod POD -n NAMESPACE -o wide
kubectl describe pod POD -n NAMESPACE
kubectl logs POD -n NAMESPACE --previous
```

PromQL:

```promql
sum by (namespace, pod, container) (
  increase(kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total[15m])
)
```

Last termination reason:

```promql
kube_pod_container_status_last_terminated_reason{reason="OOMKilled"} == 1
```

Correlate with memory working set, limit, node pressure, deployment revision and application behavior.

---

# 15.4.12 Resource request and utilization

Requests influence scheduling and node provisioning. Limits influence runtime enforcement.

CPU usage vs request:

```promql
sum by (namespace, pod) (
  rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container!="",image!=""}[5m])
)
/
sum by (namespace, pod) (
  kube_pod_container_resource_requests{resource="cpu",unit="core"}
)
```

Adapt label/unit names to the installed metrics versions.

Do not automatically reduce a request because average usage is low. Review peak, latency, throttling, one-zone failure, startup, rollout and autoscaling behavior.

---

# 15.4.13 Control-plane monitoring

High-value questions:

```text
Is the API server reachable?
Are request errors or latency increasing?
Is the scheduler falling behind?
Are admission webhooks slow/failing?
Are controllers reconciling?
Are client requests being throttled?
Is CoreDNS healthy?
```

EKS manages the control-plane hosts, but customers still need to monitor API behavior, enabled control-plane logs, quotas and workload-facing symptoms.

Managed does not mean invisible.

---

# 15.4.14 EKS-specific evidence

EKS control-plane log categories include API, audit, authenticator, controller manager and scheduler logs. Enable them according to investigation, security, retention and cost requirements rather than indiscriminately. ([AWS][2])

Also monitor:

```text
VPC CNI available IP/address pressure
CoreDNS
EBS CSI and volume operations
load balancer controller
node lifecycle and interruption
AWS API throttling
IAM/workload identity failures
NAT/cross-AZ behavior
managed add-on versions
```

CloudWatch, Prometheus and logs provide different evidence. Define authoritative sources and correlation labels such as account, region and cluster.

---

# Real-world Hands-on Tutorial

# 15.4.15 Lab — deploy a monitored workload

Create `order-api-service.yaml` for an application already running in Kubernetes:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: order-api
  namespace: orders-dev
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: order-api
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: order-api
  ports:
    - name: metrics
      port: 8000
      targetPort: 8000
```

Create `order-api-monitor.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: order-api
  namespace: monitoring
  labels:
    monitoring-stack: platform
spec:
  namespaceSelector:
    matchNames: [orders-dev]
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: order-api
  endpoints:
    - port: metrics
      path: /metrics
      interval: 30s
```

Before applying, confirm that the installed Prometheus selects the label `monitoring-stack: platform`; chart releases often use a different selector.

```bash
kubectl apply -f order-api-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f order-api-monitor.yaml
kubectl -n monitoring get servicemonitor order-api -o yaml
```

---

# 15.4.16 Lab — workload query workbook

```promql
sum by (namespace) (kube_pod_status_phase{phase="Pending"})
```

```promql
sum by (namespace, deployment) (
  kube_deployment_status_replicas_unavailable
)
```

```promql
sum by (namespace, pod) (
  increase(kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total[15m])
)
```

```promql
sum by (namespace) (
  kube_pod_container_resource_requests{resource="cpu",unit="core"}
)
```

For each result, choose one affected object and verify it with `kubectl`.

Metrics tell scale and trend. Kubernetes status and Events confirm the object-level condition.

---

# 15.4.17 Break-it lab — impossible scheduling

Create a disposable test Pod:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: impossible-schedule
  namespace: orders-dev
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    training.example.com/nonexistent: "true"
  containers:
    - name: pause
      image: registry.k8s.io/pause:REPLACE_WITH_REVIEWED_VERSION
```

Apply after pinning an available reviewed image version:

```bash
kubectl apply -f impossible-schedule.yaml
kubectl get pod impossible-schedule -n orders-dev
kubectl describe pod impossible-schedule -n orders-dev
```

Prove:

```text
Pod is Pending
scheduler Event names selector mismatch
Pending metrics reflect it
application metrics do not exist because container never ran
```

Cleanup:

```bash
kubectl delete pod impossible-schedule -n orders-dev
```

---

# 15.4.18 Break-it lab — ServiceMonitor mismatch

Change the Service label from:

```yaml
app.kubernetes.io/name: order-api
```

to:

```yaml
app.kubernetes.io/name: wrong-name
```

Expected:

```text
ServiceMonitor still exists
but its selector no longer finds the Service
target disappears rather than showing up == 0
```

Repair the authoritative manifest and reapply through GitOps in a managed environment.

---

# Expert and Professional Level

# 15.4.19 Dashboard design

A production Kubernetes overview should answer:

```text
Are clusters reachable and telemetry fresh?
Which nodes are NotReady or pressured?
Which workloads lack desired availability?
Where are Pods Pending, restarting or OOMKilled?
Are requests/limits/usage creating risk or waste?
Are API, DNS, network and storage healthy?
Which user journeys are affected?
What changed?
```

Avoid a wall of every metric. Use hierarchy and data links.

---

# 15.4.20 Security and multi-tenancy

Kubernetes metrics may expose namespaces, workload names, images, nodes and resource posture.

Controls:

```text
least-privilege ServiceAccount discovery
private scrape endpoints
TLS/auth where needed
NetworkPolicy for metrics traffic
tenant query/dashboard authorization
restricted control-plane logs
safe labels without customer identity
audit of monitoring configuration
```

Monitoring ServiceAccounts should not become cluster-admin merely because discovery is convenient.

---

# 15.4.21 Capacity and cardinality

Cluster growth multiplies series:

```text
clusters × nodes × Pods × containers × metrics × labels
```

Control:

```text
drop unused metrics only with evidence
limit annotation/label allowlists in kube-state-metrics
normalize workload identity
shorten scrape interval only where justified
use recording rules for repeated fleet queries
separate tenant/failure domains at scale
```

Do not drop the metrics required for incident response or SLO calculation to save a small amount without stakeholder review.

---

# Certification and Interview Preparation

# 15.4.22 Certification focus

For PCA and Kubernetes-related exams, understand:

```text
service discovery
exporters vs application metrics
target labels
resource state vs actual usage
counter rate
Kubernetes object relationships
scrape troubleshooting
```

Practice question:

```text
Which component primarily exposes Kubernetes object state such as
Deployment desired and available replicas?

A. node_exporter
B. kube-state-metrics
C. Alertmanager
D. Tempo
```

Answer:

```text
B. kube-state-metrics
```

---

# 15.4.23 Interview answers and final checklist

## kube-state-metrics vs metrics-server?

> **kube-state-metrics exposes Kubernetes object state for Prometheus-style monitoring. Metrics Server supplies resource metrics used by APIs such as `kubectl top` and Horizontal Pod Autoscaler; it is not intended as a full historical monitoring backend.**

## Pod is Pending—how do you debug?

> **I inspect the Pod condition and scheduler Events, then distinguish resource shortage, affinity/selector, taint/toleration, PVC, quota, topology, IP or policy constraints. I use metrics to scope whether this is one Pod or a cluster trend, fix the authoritative manifest/capacity cause, and verify scheduling and readiness.**

## All Pods are Running but users fail—what next?

> **Running phase only describes container lifecycle. I check readiness and Service endpoints, ingress/DNS/network, application RED metrics, traces, logs and dependencies, correlate the deployment version, and validate the critical user journey.**

Final checklist:

```text
□ I distinguish object state from resource usage
□ I understand kube-state-metrics and node exporter roles
□ I can investigate Pending, restart and OOM conditions
□ I can relate requests to scheduling/autoscaling
□ I monitor control plane, DNS, network and storage
□ I know EKS-specific evidence sources
□ I can configure and debug a ServiceMonitor
□ I connect Kubernetes health to user health
□ Monitoring permissions and labels are safe
□ Capacity/cardinality grow intentionally
```

Next: recording rules and actionable alerting.

# 15.4.24 Professional Mastery Workbook

This workbook expands **Kubernetes and EKS Monitoring** into deliberate practice without replacing the authored tutorial above.

Use it after reading the core explanation. The goal is not to memorize thousands of lines; the goal is to repeatedly explain, build, break, secure, observe, recover, and defend the lesson in different conditions.

## Workbook learning contract

- Concepts covered: 23 lesson-specific anchors.
- Progression: beginner, intermediate, expert, professional, industry-ready, certification review, and interview defense.
- Safety: use synthetic data, disposable resources, explicit placeholders, least privilege, and bounded failure experiments.
- Completion: retain commands or configuration, observations, screenshots or query output, decisions, rollback evidence, and a short reflection.
- Quality rule: a passing answer states assumptions, protects a user or business outcome, names ownership, and validates the final result end to end.
- Currency rule: verify current official documentation, versions, limits, pricing, and certification objectives before relying on changing product behavior.

## Seven-stage progression

| Stage | Learner must demonstrate |
|---|---|
| Beginner | Explain the concept in plain language and give one safe example. |
| Intermediate | Connect components, data, control flow, and normal operating behavior. |
| Expert | Analyze trade-offs, edge cases, scaling pressure, and correlated failures. |
| Professional | Make a reviewed decision with owner, evidence, rollout, and rollback. |
| Industry-ready | Operate the design under security, failure, recovery, cost, and compliance constraints. |
| Certification review | Map durable concepts to the latest official objectives without relying on stale wording. |
| Interview defense | Answer concisely, clarify assumptions, draw the model, and defend alternatives. |
