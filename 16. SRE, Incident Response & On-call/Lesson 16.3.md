# Module 16 — SRE, Incident Response & On-call

## Lesson 3: Risk, Availability Mathematics and Capacity

# 16.3.1 Reliability composition

For independent serial dependencies, approximate availability multiplies:

```text
A_total = A_frontend × A_api × A_database × A_identity
```

Adding dependencies can reduce end-to-end availability even when each appears highly available. Parallel redundant paths improve availability only when they do not share the same failure domain.

# 16.3.2 Failure domains

Map:

```text
process → pod → node → zone → region → cloud/provider
identity → DNS → network → compute → storage → dependency
code/config → deployment system → human/operator
```

Two replicas on one node are not node-tolerant. Two regions using one global writable database or identity provider may still share a critical dependency.

# 16.3.3 Capacity model

```text
required capacity = peak demand × growth × safety margin
usable capacity   = provisioned × efficiency × healthy fraction
```

Model steady state, burst, one-zone loss, rollout surge, retry amplification, maintenance, and recovery. Validate with load tests that resemble request mix and dependency behavior.

Little's Law provides a useful sanity check:

```text
concurrency ≈ throughput × average time in system
```

Longer latency increases in-flight work even at unchanged request rate.

# 16.3.4 Risk register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Detection | Prevention | Recovery | Owner |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|---|
| Regional database loss | Low | Critical | replication alarms | multi-AZ/cross-region | tested failover | data team |

Prioritize expected loss, regulatory exposure, irreversibility, and error-budget impact—not only likelihood.

# 16.3.5 Lab

Draw the dependency graph for a service. Calculate approximate availability, identify correlated failures, estimate N+1 capacity, then test one-node and one-zone loss. Record actual throughput, latency, queueing, and recovery.

# 16.3.6 Never-forget rules

1. Redundancy without independence is decoration.
2. Retries consume capacity and may amplify failure.
3. Recovery time includes detection and decision time.
4. Capacity must survive the planned failure model.
5. Availability is an end-to-end user property.

# 16.3.7 Beginner mental model: a chain is limited by the whole path

If a restaurant depends on electricity, water, cooks, payment, and delivery, perfect cooks do not keep it open when electricity fails. A digital service is also an end-to-end dependency chain.

Reliability engineering asks:

```text
What must work for the user journey?
Which failures are independent or correlated?
What capacity remains after the assumed failure?
How quickly can we detect, decide, and recover?
What risk is worth reducing at what cost?
```

# 16.3.8 Serial availability example

For an end-to-end journey requiring three independent serial components:

```text
API       99.95% = 0.9995
database  99.99% = 0.9999
identity  99.90% = 0.9990

combined ≈ 0.9995 × 0.9999 × 0.9990
         ≈ 0.9984 = 99.84%
```

This is an approximation. Failures are often correlated, measurements use different windows/definitions, and fallbacks can change the path. The calculation reveals budget pressure; it is not a substitute for measured journey SLIs.

# 16.3.9 Redundant-path mathematics

For two truly independent equivalent paths, each with failure probability `q`:

```text
probability both fail = q₁ × q₂
parallel availability = 1 - (q₁ × q₂)
```

Two 99% paths could theoretically provide 99.99% path availability if failures and switching are independent and the failover mechanism works. Shared DNS, credentials, deployment, data store, region, or configuration invalidates that assumption.

# 16.3.10 Failure-domain map

Create a layered diagram:

```text
USER
  -> DNS/CDN
  -> region/load balancer
  -> cluster/ingress
  -> namespace/service/pods
  -> database/cache/queue
  -> identity/payment/external APIs

CONTROL PLANE
  Git -> CI -> registry -> Argo CD -> Kubernetes/cloud APIs

SHARED FOUNDATIONS
  network, time, certificates, secrets, quotas, people
```

Mark where replicas, data, identities, and control paths share fate. Include human and supplier failure domains.

# 16.3.11 Capacity is a failure requirement

Suppose three zones each have 120 units of usable capacity and peak demand is 250:

```text
normal capacity = 360, utilization = 69%
one-zone loss   = 240, which is below peak 250
```

The system looks comfortable normally but cannot meet N+1. Either add capacity, shed low-priority work, reduce demand, improve efficiency, or change the failure objective.

Account for rollout surge, unavailable pods, warm-up, autoscaler lag, quota, dependency capacity, and recovery traffic.

# 16.3.12 Queueing and Little's Law

At 500 requests/s and 200 ms average time:

```text
average in-flight = 500 × 0.2 = 100 requests
```

If latency rises to 2 seconds at the same arrival rate:

```text
average in-flight = 500 × 2 = 1,000 requests
```

That increases memory, connections, thread/task pressure, and downstream concurrency. Near saturation, latency can grow nonlinearly. Measure queue time separately from service time.

# 16.3.13 Retry amplification

If 1,000 client requests each make up to three attempts, the dependency can see as many as 3,000 attempts during failure. Add retries at several layers and amplification becomes worse.

Use:

```text
timeouts based on end-to-end deadline
bounded retries only for safe/transient outcomes
exponential backoff and jitter
retry budgets
circuit breaking/load shedding
idempotency for retried mutations
```

Instrument original requests, attempts, final outcomes, and discarded/load-shed work separately.

# 16.3.14 Capacity forecast

Document inputs rather than one magic number:

```text
current peak by region/tenant/operation
seasonality and event bursts
organic growth rate
request mix and cost per operation
healthy efficiency
failure-mode healthy fraction
deployment/maintenance reserve
autoscaling and provisioning lead time
downstream quotas and connection limits
```

For irreversible capacity such as database storage or address space, alert on time-to-exhaustion early enough to provision safely.

# 16.3.15 Risk scoring beyond red/amber/green

Use a consistent but humble model:

```text
risk exposure ≈ likelihood × impact
```

Then adjust priority for detectability, recovery difficulty, regulatory/safety consequence, common-mode scope, and uncertainty. Numeric scores create comparison, not mathematical truth.

A good risk entry includes evidence, prevention, detection, mitigation, recovery, owner, due date, and residual accepted risk.

# 16.3.16 Real hands-on: dependency and capacity workbook

For `todo-api`:

1. Draw the write and read journeys.
2. List each serial/optional/redundant dependency.
3. Record objective, owner, timeout, fallback, quota, and failure domain.
4. Calculate a rough serial availability bound.
5. Model peak normal, rollout, node loss, and zone loss.
6. Load test the realistic request mix.
7. Compare calculated concurrency with observed connections/tasks.
8. Add the top five risks with actionable owners.

# 16.3.17 Failure lab: zone loss

In a safe environment, remove one zone's worker capacity or simulate equivalent pod unavailability. Measure:

```text
traffic redistribution
pending/evicted pods and topology constraints
autoscaler/provisioning time
latency, errors, saturation, queue age
database/cache connection pressure
retry amplification
time to steady degraded state and full recovery
```

Abort before affecting shared production unless the experiment has explicit approval and guardrails.

# 16.3.18 Failure lab: dependency brownout

A brownout is slow or partially failing behavior, not a clean outage. Inject latency for a fraction of dependency calls. Validate deadline propagation, retry budget, circuit breaker/load shedding, queueing, and whether user SLO burn alerts detect it.

Healthy TCP connections or pods do not prove a dependency meets the journey's latency objective.

# 16.3.19 Capacity review checklist

- Peak and burst are based on measured request mix.
- Expected growth and seasonality have dates/confidence.
- N+1 or chosen failure model still meets the objective.
- Deployment and maintenance headroom are reserved.
- Autoscaling lead time and quotas are tested.
- Retry/recovery traffic is included.
- Dependencies have capacity/quotas and owners.
- Load shedding protects critical work.
- Forecast alerts lead provisioning time.
- Cost and residual risk are accepted explicitly.

# 16.3.20 Certification and interview preparation

Availability composition, failure domains, capacity, and risk are common cloud reliability and SRE competencies. For certification, validate current official objectives and service-specific behavior.

**Beginner: Why does adding a dependency reduce reliability?**  The user journey now requires another component; serial availability is constrained by every required component.

**Intermediate: When does redundancy help?**  When paths are sufficiently independent, failover works, data remains correct, and remaining capacity can carry demand.

**Intermediate: What is N+1 capacity?**  Enough capacity to meet the objective after losing one defined unit/failure domain.

**Senior: How does latency cause an outage without more traffic?**  Longer time in system raises concurrency and queueing, consuming connections, memory, workers, and downstream capacity.

**Senior: Why are retries dangerous?**  They can amplify load during a dependency failure, extend work beyond deadlines, and duplicate unsafe mutations.

**Expert: How do you prioritize a low-likelihood catastrophic risk?**  Include impact, irreversibility, regulation/safety, detectability, recovery, correlation, and uncertainty—not likelihood alone—and obtain explicit risk acceptance.

**Architect: How do you validate a multi-region claim?**  Map shared dependencies/control planes, model data consistency and capacity, then test failover, routing, identity, quotas, RPO/RTO, and failback.

**Never-forget answer:** redundancy only counts when failure is independent, switching is correct, and remaining capacity meets the user objective.
