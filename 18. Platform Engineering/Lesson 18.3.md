# Module 18 — Platform Engineering

## Lesson 3: Software Catalog, Ownership and Scorecards

A software catalog creates a queryable ownership and dependency model. Backstage models software metadata in YAML colocated with code and makes services and owners discoverable. ([Backstage][1])

# 18.3.1 Entity model

```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: todo-api
  annotations:
    backstage.io/techdocs-ref: dir:.
    github.com/project-slug: example/todo-api
spec:
  type: service
  lifecycle: production
  owner: group:default/team-todo
  system: system:default/todo
  providesApis: [api:default/todo-http]
  dependsOn:
    - resource:default/todo-postgres
```

Validate allowed owners, lifecycle, entity relations, and annotations in CI. Ownership must resolve to an active group and escalation path.

# 18.3.2 Catalog quality

```text
completeness → all production assets represented
correctness  → metadata matches reality
freshness    → stale entities detected
ownership    → no orphan critical service
relations    → dependencies and APIs useful
```

Discovery automation can find resources, but it does not prove correct business ownership. Reconcile cloud/Kubernetes/Git inventory against the catalog.

# 18.3.3 Scorecards

Scorecards communicate maturity, not shame teams. Example checks:

```text
owner and on-call present
SLO and dashboard linked
runbook tested
critical vulnerabilities within policy
deployment uses immutable artifact
backup restore recently proven
resource requests/cost allocation present
supported runtime version
```

Define evidence, weight, exceptions, expiry, and action. Do not collapse all risk into one unexplained percentage.

# 18.3.4 Docs as code

Technical documentation belongs near the service and is rendered through the portal. Include architecture, setup, API, SLO, runbooks, data classification, ownership, and changes. Test links and freshness.

# 18.3.5 Lab

Catalog five services, two APIs, one system, three groups, and shared resources. Intentionally orphan one service and create a circular dependency. Add validation that blocks invalid ownership and reports dependency risks.

# 18.3.6 Beginner mental model: a living city directory

During an incident, responders need to know what a service is, who owns it, where its code and dashboards live, what it depends on, and how critical it is. A software catalog is a living operational directory—not an inventory spreadsheet updated once a year.

# 18.3.7 Entity model

Common relationships:

```text
Domain: Customer Experience
  -> System: Todo Platform
      -> Component: todo-api
      -> Component: todo-worker
      -> Resource: todo-postgres
      -> API: todo-public-api

Group: team-todo owns components/APIs/resources
User: people belong to groups
```

Use the smallest useful taxonomy. Excessive entity types/relations make ownership harder rather than clearer.

# 18.3.8 Catalog metadata contract

```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: todo-api
  description: Authoritative todo HTTP API
  annotations:
    backstage.io/techdocs-ref: dir:.
spec:
  type: service
  lifecycle: production
  owner: group:default/team-todo
  system: todo-platform
  providesApis: [todo-http-api]
  dependsOn:
    - resource:default/todo-postgres
```

Treat this as an example. Validate against the current Backstage entity model and organization conventions.

# 18.3.9 Source-of-truth strategy

Prefer catalog descriptors close to the service repository for developer-owned metadata. Derive deployed version/runtime/cloud facts from trusted systems rather than forcing manual duplication.

```text
Git: intended owner, lifecycle, API, docs references
runtime/GitOps: deployed revision, cluster/environment status
identity directory: valid teams/users
cloud inventory: resources/cost tags
incident system: escalation schedule
```

Define conflict authority and reconciliation.

# 18.3.10 Ownership quality

Validate:

```text
owner group exists and has active members
on-call/escalation exists for critical service
repository and default branch accessible
dashboard/runbook/SLO links resolve
dependency owners exist
lifecycle/tier/data classification are allowed values
orphan transfer occurs during reorganizations
```

Avoid individual people as durable production owners; use managed groups/teams.

# 18.3.11 Catalog ingestion and permissions

Catalog ingestion parses external metadata and may reach repositories/URLs. Threat-model malicious descriptors, SSRF, excessive entity graphs, permission escalation, and secrets in annotations.

Allow trusted locations/integrations, least-privilege repository access, schema/policy checks, permission controls, audit, and resource limits. A catalog is not a safe place for credentials.

# 18.3.12 Scorecards without shame

A scorecard should expose readiness and improvement:

```text
owner/runbook/SLO present and valid
supported CI/template version
production artifact uses immutable digest
critical alerts have tested runbooks
backups restored inside RTO/RPO
telemetry schema/cardinality/security controls
runtime version supported
cost allocation metadata present
```

Show evidence, rationale, exceptions, and actions. Do not create a public team leaderboard from a simplistic score.

# 18.3.13 Scorecard rule design

Each rule needs:

```yaml
id: production-runbook-valid
applies_to: production tier-1 components
reason: enables timely safe incident response
evidence_source: catalog URL check + last-tested metadata
pass: link resolves and tested_at within 180 days
owner: platform-reliability
remediation: runbook-template-link
exception: approved with owner and expiry
```

Automated evidence should be reproducible and resilient to temporary provider outages.

# 18.3.14 TechDocs/docs-as-code

Keep architecture, local development, API behavior, operations, SLO/runbook, recovery, and ownership close to reviewed code where useful. Build/publish docs through a controlled pipeline and link them from the entity.

Protect rendering from untrusted content and avoid embedding secrets. Test code examples and links.

# 18.3.15 Real hands-on: build a mini catalog

Create descriptors for:

```text
Domain -> System -> API + two Components + database Resource
Group owner with escalation reference
TechDocs documentation
dependency relationships
production tier/data classification/SLO/runbook annotations
```

Register them in a lab Backstage instance or validate with supported tooling. Search by owner/system/lifecycle and navigate dependency/operations links.

# 18.3.16 Automated quality checks

In CI, check:

- schema and naming convention;
- allowed owner/team directory;
- unique entity identity;
- repository, docs, dashboard, runbook URL policy;
- tier-required fields;
- forbidden secrets/sensitive annotations;
- dependency cycles where meaningful;
- safe location/integration source.

Run periodic reconciliation for data that can drift after merge.

# 18.3.17 Failure exercise: orphaned critical service

Remove/rename the owner group in a lab. Ensure catalog quality detects a Tier-1 orphan, routes to an accountable organizational owner, and blocks silent operational acceptance. Repair the source group/entity and record service-transfer procedure.

# 18.3.18 Failure exercise: stale green score

Make a runbook URL return 404 while its presence check remains “green.” Strengthen the rule to validate reachability, access semantics, and last-tested evidence. Then simulate a provider outage so the score becomes “unknown” rather than unfairly failing every team.

# 18.3.19 Catalog operating model

Define platform owner, schema governance, integration upgrades, SLO/support, backup/restore, permission review, entity deletion, and adoption/migration. Catalog availability should not stop running services, but loss can impair incident response and delivery.

Measure entity freshness, orphan rate, invalid links, ingestion errors, search/task success, and use during incidents.

# 18.3.20 Certification and interview preparation

Catalogs, ownership, documentation, and readiness controls are common platform-engineering competencies. Confirm current Backstage behavior and chosen certification objectives.

**Beginner: What is a software catalog?**  A searchable model of software entities, ownership, relationships, and operational links.

**Intermediate: Where should metadata live?**  Developer-owned intent often lives with code; runtime/identity/cloud facts should come from their trusted systems and reconcile into the catalog.

**Intermediate: What is a scorecard?**  Evidence-based evaluation of selected readiness standards with reason/remediation/exception—not a popularity ranking.

**Senior: How do you prevent stale metadata?**  Schema CI, team/link validation, trusted-system integrations, periodic reconciliation, orphan alerts, and service-transfer workflow.

**Senior: How can catalog ingestion be dangerous?**  Untrusted locations/descriptors can cause SSRF, data disclosure, graph/resource abuse, or permission issues; constrain sources and access.

**Expert: How do you handle scorecard provider failure?**  Represent unknown/stale separately from fail, preserve last evidence with age, and avoid organization-wide false noncompliance.

**Architect: What makes a catalog operationally valuable?**  Trusted ownership and dependency/operations links integrated into alerts, delivery, security, cost, incident, and lifecycle workflows.

**Never-forget answer:** a catalog is useful when ownership and links are trusted at the moment of change or incident. Automate freshness, explain scores, and keep authority clear.

# 18.3.21 Professional Mastery Workbook

This workbook expands **Software Catalog, Ownership and Scorecards** into deliberate practice without replacing the authored tutorial above.

Use it after reading the core explanation. The goal is not to memorize thousands of lines; the goal is to repeatedly explain, build, break, secure, observe, recover, and defend the lesson in different conditions.

## Workbook learning contract

- Concepts covered: 20 lesson-specific anchors.
- Progression: beginner, intermediate, expert, professional, industry-ready, certification review, and interview defense.
- Safety: use synthetic data, disposable resources, explicit placeholders, least privilege, and bounded failure experiments.
- Completion: retain commands or configuration, observations, screenshots or query output, decisions, rollback evidence, and a short reflection.
- Quality rule: a passing answer states assumptions, protects a user or business outcome, names ownership, and validates the final result end to end.
- Currency rule: verify current official documentation, versions, limits, pricing, and certification objectives before relying on changing product behavior.

## Seven-stage progression

| Stage | Learner must demonstrate |
|---|---|
| Beginner | Explain the concept in plain language and give one safe example. |
| Intermediate | Connect components, data, control flow, and normal operating behavior. |
| Expert | Analyze trade-offs, edge cases, scaling pressure, and correlated failures. |
| Professional | Make a reviewed decision with owner, evidence, rollout, and rollback. |
| Industry-ready | Operate the design under security, failure, recovery, cost, and compliance constraints. |
| Certification review | Map durable concepts to the latest official objectives without relying on stale wording. |
| Interview defense | Answer concisely, clarify assumptions, draw the model, and defend alternatives. |
