# Module 15 — Observability

## Lesson 14: Production Observability Architecture

# 15.14.1 Reference architecture

```text
EKS workloads
├── /metrics ───────────────► Prometheus

└── OTLP ─► OTel gateways ─────► Tempo

Prometheus/Loki/Tempo ─► object/remote durable storage
               │
               ▼
             Grafana ─► SSO users
Prometheus alerts ─► Alertmanager ─► pager/chat/email
```

Run collectors close to sources, keep storage/query tiers private, and expose Grafana through authenticated ingress. Separate production telemetry from lower environments when access, blast radius, retention, or scale demands it.

# 15.14.2 Availability objectives

Define distinct objectives:

```text
collection freshness
query availability/latency
alert evaluation continuity
notification delivery latency
retention/durability
```

The paging path often deserves stronger availability than exploratory dashboards. Monitor observability from outside itself with synthetic probes and independent delivery checks.

# 15.14.3 Capacity model

Estimate before deployment:

```text
metric samples/s = targets × series/target ÷ scrape interval
log bytes/day    = events/s × average bytes × 86,400
trace spans/day  = requests/s × spans/request × sampled fraction × 86,400
```

Add peak, replication, index, compression, retention, query concurrency, and growth. Measure actual compression and cardinality rather than trusting generic ratios.

# 15.14.4 Multi-cluster choices

```text
per-cluster collection + central query
central collection across clusters
regional telemetry stacks
fully isolated regulated stacks
```

Prefer failure-domain containment. A central system simplifies discovery but creates network and blast-radius dependencies. Regional stacks with global query often balance scale and resilience.

# 15.14.5 Design exercise

Produce an architecture decision record covering tenant model, network paths, identities, encryption, storage, retention, HA, DR, capacity, cost, data residency, upgrades, and ownership. Include failure modes for DNS, object storage, one Availability Zone, identity provider, and notification provider.

# 15.14.6 Beginner mental model: a city emergency system

A city does not depend on one camera, one phone, and one operator. It has local sensors, dispatch centers, records, escalation routes, access rules, and backup communication. Production observability needs the same separation:

```text
collection -> processing -> storage -> query -> decision -> notification
```

Each arrow is a network, identity, capacity, and failure boundary. A diagram that shows only product logos hides the decisions engineers actually need to make.

# 15.14.7 Start from user journeys and owners

Before selecting topology, list critical services and journeys:

| Journey | Owner | Primary SLI | Evidence needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Create todo | Todo team | successful creates / valid attempts | HTTP + worker + DB |
| Sign in | Identity team | successful sign-ins / attempts | gateway + identity dependency |
| Deploy service | Platform team | commit-to-healthy time | CI + Argo CD + workload SLI |

The architecture must preserve these signals at required freshness and retention. “Collect everything centrally” is not a requirement; “page the owner within five minutes of sustained user impact” is.

# 15.14.8 Define the telemetry platform's own SLOs

Separate objectives prevent misleading availability claims:

```text
ingestion freshness: can recent telemetry reach durable storage?
query service: can responders execute important queries?
rule evaluation: are scheduled evaluations current?
page delivery: did urgent notifications reach an on-call endpoint?
durability: is retained data recoverable for the promised period?
```

Grafana availability does not prove alert evaluation or ingestion. A broken exploratory dashboard might be tolerable while delayed paging is critical. Assign owners and error budgets to the paths that matter.

# 15.14.9 Trust and network boundaries

Annotate the reference architecture with zones:

```text
workload namespace
  -> authenticated collector/metrics endpoint
cluster observability namespace
  -> encrypted private regional endpoint
regional telemetry account/project
  -> object storage and query services
corporate identity boundary
  -> Grafana/administration
external notification provider
  -> pager/SMS/chat delivery
```

For every crossing, record source identity, destination, port/protocol, encryption, authentication, authorization, timeout/retry, data classification, and owning team.

# 15.14.10 Metrics architecture choices

A single Prometheus is excellent for a lab or bounded cluster. At larger scale, common options include:

```text
per-cluster Prometheus + remote durable/query layer
sharded Prometheus instances by target or label
managed Prometheus-compatible service
regional query federation/global view
```

Prometheus local storage is not clustered storage. Two replicas scraping the same targets provide collection/evaluation redundancy, but each has its own TSDB. Long-term retention and global querying require a deliberately selected remote/distributed architecture.

Keep urgent rule evaluation close enough to the source that a wide-area query outage does not eliminate all paging.

# 15.14.11 Log and trace architecture choices

Loki and Tempo can begin in simple/single-process modes and later separate ingestion, query, storage, and compaction roles. Select deployment mode based on measured load and availability—not fashion.

Object storage provides a durable foundation, but it does not solve:

- bad tenant isolation or overly broad credentials;
- ingestion queues and rejected data;
- slow or unbounded queries;
- schema/retention mistakes;
- regional network failure;
- tested restoration of configuration and metadata.

Document which state is reconstructable from object storage and which control-plane/configuration state needs backup.

# 15.14.12 Multi-cluster topology decision

Compare alternatives with explicit tradeoffs:

| Topology | Strength | Risk/control needed |
|---|---|---|
| Fully central ingestion | One policy/query plane | WAN dependency and large blast radius |
| Per-cluster full stack | Strong isolation | High operational duplication |
| Regional stacks | Contains failure and residency | Global query/routing complexity |
| Local collectors + managed backend | Less storage operation | Vendor/service dependency and egress |

Regulated workloads may require separate accounts, keys, administrators, retention, and physical regions. A label called `tenant` is not by itself isolation.

# 15.14.13 Capacity workbook

Create low, expected, and peak scenarios. Example inputs:

```text
Kubernetes nodes and pods
metric targets and series per target
scrape interval and sample size
log bytes/second by service and peak multiplier
requests/second, spans/request, and sampled fraction
retention days per signal/tenant
dashboard users and concurrent query range
replication and object-store request rates
annual growth and incident burst factor
```

Worked metric example:

```text
400 targets × 2,000 series ÷ 30 s = about 26,667 samples/s
```

Worked trace example:

```text
5,000 requests/s × 12 spans × 10% sampling
= 6,000 spans/s before retries/overhead
```

Use load tests and real compression measurements to turn estimates into budgets.

# 15.14.14 Cost attribution and guardrails

Attribute cost with bounded organizational dimensions such as service owner, team, environment, cluster, and tenant where safe. Report:

```text
active metric series and samples
log bytes and streams
trace spans and retained volume
object storage and API operations
query CPU/cache usage
network transfer
retention class
```

Budgets need a response: warn, identify the source, reduce unsafe dimensions, sample/filter intentionally, or approve an exception. Silent hard limits can hide an incident by dropping the very telemetry responders need.

# 15.14.15 High availability and failure domains

Draw replicas across nodes and zones, then test whether dependencies share the same hidden failure:

```text
two pods on one node       != node HA
three pods in one zone     != zone HA
multi-zone compute with one NAT/DNS path != full path HA
two collectors exporting through one gateway != gateway HA
```

Use topology spread/anti-affinity, disruption controls, multiple endpoints where clients require them, durable queues where justified, and independently reachable page delivery. Ensure constraints remain schedulable during maintenance.

# 15.14.16 Disaster recovery and restore objectives

Define RPO and RTO separately for:

```text
Git-managed configuration
dashboards and folders
alert/routing configuration and silences
local TSDB or remote storage
Loki/Tempo object storage
tenant/authentication metadata
encryption keys and secrets
runbooks and ownership data
```

Git can restore declarative configuration but not every runtime state or historical dataset. Object versioning can protect against deletion but requires key access and tested restoration. Run a restore rehearsal into an isolated environment and query known historical synthetic data.

# 15.14.17 Real hands-on architecture design exercise

Design for this scenario:

```text
3 EKS clusters across 2 AWS regions
250 services, 3 environments
20,000 requests/s peak
production logs retained 30 days
traces retained 7 days with policy sampling
metrics queried globally for 13 months
payments telemetry isolated from general developers
urgent paging must survive loss of one cluster
```

Produce five diagrams/views:

1. Component and data-flow view.
2. Network/trust boundary view.
3. Identity and authorization view.
4. Failure-domain and DR view.
5. Capacity and cost allocation view.

Every arrow must list protocol, identity, encryption, retry/queue boundary, and expected behavior when the destination is unavailable.

# 15.14.18 Architecture decision record template

```markdown
# ADR: Regional observability topology

## Context and measurable requirements
## Options considered
## Decision
## Data and control flows
## Availability and failure behavior
## Security/privacy/residency
## Capacity and cost assumptions
## Backup, restore, and upgrades
## Rejected alternatives and tradeoffs
## Validation experiments
## Owners and review date
```

An ADR records why a choice fits the current system. It is not a timeless claim that one product or topology is always best.

# 15.14.19 Failure-mode review

For each scenario, state detection, user impact, automatic behavior, operator action, and proof of recovery:

```text
cluster-to-region link lost
one Availability Zone lost
object-store throttling or denied access
central identity provider unavailable
certificate expires
one tenant increases ingestion 20×
bad Collector configuration rolls out
query causes overload
Alertmanager or notification provider unavailable
region becomes unreachable
```

Include correlated failures. For example, a zone loss can increase queue and query pressure on remaining replicas.

# 15.14.20 Upgrade and change strategy

Version-pin components and compatibility-test the complete path:

```text
instrumentation/OTLP -> Collectors -> storage -> queries -> dashboards/alerts
```

Read upstream notes, back up necessary state, validate config and APIs, canary the change, watch ingestion gaps/rejections and query correctness, retain a reversible rollback plan, and rehearse schema migrations. A green pod rollout is not proof that historical queries and alerts still work.

# 15.14.21 Production readiness review

A review should reject the design until these questions have evidence:

- Which user journeys and paging paths does the stack protect?
- What are the RPO/RTO and retention promises?
- Where can telemetry be dropped, duplicated, delayed, or spoofed?
- How is each tenant authenticated and authorized?
- What happens at 2× expected peak and during backlog recovery?
- Can one service exhaust shared ingestion or query capacity?
- How is the observability stack monitored independently?
- Who owns upgrades, storage, schema, on-call, and cost?
- Has one zone, one region, storage denial, and page failure been tested?

# 15.14.22 Certification and interview preparation

This architecture lesson supports production design skills across Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, Kubernetes, cloud, and SRE learning paths. Certification products and objectives evolve, so validate current official requirements separately.

**Beginner: Why separate collection, storage, and visualization?**  They have different scale, failure, security, and availability requirements.

**Intermediate: Is two Prometheus replicas a shared HA database?**  No. Each replica has its own local TSDB and usually scrapes independently; durable global storage/query requires an additional deliberate design.

**Senior: Central or per-cluster telemetry?**  Choose based on latency, WAN dependence, isolation, residency, cost, operations, and blast radius. Regional or hybrid designs often balance these concerns.

**Senior: What should remain available if Grafana fails?**  Urgent rule evaluation and page delivery should ideally continue where architecture objectives require it; keep low-dependency diagnostic access and runbooks.

**Expert: How do you size an observability platform?**  Model per-signal ingest, cardinality/streams/spans, retention, replication, query concurrency, burst and growth; then validate compression and recovery throughput with load tests.

**Architect: How do you prove disaster recovery?**  Restore configuration, identity dependencies, keys, and representative historical data into isolation, execute known queries/alerts, and measure actual RPO/RTO.

**Never-forget answer:** design observability as a production service with user objectives, trust boundaries, capacity, failure domains, recovery, cost, and owners—not as a collection of product logos.

# 15.14.23 Professional Mastery Workbook

This workbook expands **Production Observability Architecture** into deliberate practice without replacing the authored tutorial above.

Use it after reading the core explanation. The goal is not to memorize thousands of lines; the goal is to repeatedly explain, build, break, secure, observe, recover, and defend the lesson in different conditions.

## Workbook learning contract

- Concepts covered: 22 lesson-specific anchors.
- Progression: beginner, intermediate, expert, professional, industry-ready, certification review, and interview defense.
- Safety: use synthetic data, disposable resources, explicit placeholders, least privilege, and bounded failure experiments.
- Completion: retain commands or configuration, observations, screenshots or query output, decisions, rollback evidence, and a short reflection.
- Quality rule: a passing answer states assumptions, protects a user or business outcome, names ownership, and validates the final result end to end.
- Currency rule: verify current official documentation, versions, limits, pricing, and certification objectives before relying on changing product behavior.

## Seven-stage progression

| Stage | Learner must demonstrate |
|---|---|

- Safe execution rule: use synthetic data, explicit placeholders, a disposable target, least privilege, and a written abort condition.
- Read-only first check: capture current version, configuration, health, recent changes, workload scope, and the exact user signal.
- Failure injection: inject a scrape, discovery, or label mismatch.
- Expected observation: predict one user signal, one component signal, and one control-plane or change signal before running the test.
- Troubleshooting branch: write two competing hypotheses and the cheapest safe check that distinguishes them.
- Security check: test unauthorized access, unsafe input, secret exposure, excessive privilege, and audit evidence where relevant.
- Reliability check: test timeout, retry, partial success, duplicate work, degraded mode, and recovery within the stated objective.
- Performance and cost check: record demand, latency or queueing, capacity, amplification, paid resources, and one useful unit.
- Rollback or containment: identify the smallest reversible action, its authority, expected result, risk, and stop condition.
- Recovery proof: validate the original user journey, authoritative state, backlog, telemetry, desired-state convergence, and side effects.
- Evidence package: save sanitized configuration or command, query output, UTC timeline, decision, result, and unresolved risk.
- Certification checkpoint: Map the result to the current Prometheus or OpenTelemetry objectives and state which behavior was proved.
- Interview prompt: Defend **Availability objectives** against an alternative while protecting delivery safety under this scenario.
- Strong-answer outline: clarify requirements; draw the mechanism; quantify scale; cover security and failure; choose; validate; state limitation.
- Common mistake to avoid: naming a tool, replica count, dashboard, or discount as proof without demonstrating the end-to-end outcome.
- Completion rule: another learner can reproduce the safe test, explain the evidence, and reach the same conclusion without private coaching.
