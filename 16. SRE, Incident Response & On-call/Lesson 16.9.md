# Module 16 — SRE, Incident Response & On-call

## Lesson 9: Resilience Testing, Backup and Disaster Recovery

# 16.9.1 Recovery vocabulary

```text
RTO  maximum acceptable recovery time
RPO  maximum acceptable data loss measured in time
backup  recoverable copy
HA      continuity through component/failure-domain loss
DR      restoration after large control-plane/site/region loss
```

A backup is only evidence after a successful restore test. Multi-AZ is not automatically regional DR. Replication can copy corruption.

# 16.9.2 Resilience experiment

Define before execution:

```text
hypothesis
steady-state SLI
exact fault and scope
blast-radius guardrail
abort condition
owner/approver
observability
recovery method
learning objective
```

Begin in a safe environment, then progressively increase realism. Never run uncontrolled destructive chaos in production.

# 16.9.3 DR plan

```text
people and declaration authority
fencing/split-brain prevention
infrastructure and identity restoration
version-pinned platform install
configuration and secret recovery
data restore/failover
DNS/traffic switch
integrity and user-journey validation
return-to-primary strategy
```

Dependencies such as Git, artifact registry, DNS, KMS, identity, certificates, and external providers belong in the plan.

# 16.9.4 Game-day scenarios

1. One Kubernetes node fails.
2. One Availability Zone becomes unreachable.
3. Database writer fails.
4. Secret provider is unavailable.
5. GitOps control plane is lost.
6. Region is isolated.
7. Backup contains corrupt or missing data.

Measure detection, declaration, decision, technical recovery, validation, actual RTO/RPO, data integrity, and manual steps.

# 16.9.5 Kubernetes caution

PodDisruptionBudgets help with supported voluntary disruptions, but do not protect against every deletion or involuntary failure. Replicas, topology, resource requests, readiness, and application behavior are still required. ([Kubernetes][1])

# 16.9.6 Interview answer

> **HA masks selected component or failure-domain loss; DR restores service after a larger event. I define RTO/RPO per journey and data class, map all dependencies, protect backups independently, fence competing writers/controllers, and run game days that measure actual detection, decision, restoration, integrity, and user recovery.**

# 16.9.7 Beginner mental model: spare tire, duplicate car, and route home

A spare tire is useful only if it fits, has air, and someone can install it. A second car can keep you moving through one car failure. A plan for reaching home after the whole road closes is different again.

```text
backup = recovery material
restore = proven process that turns material into usable state
HA = service continuity through selected failures
DR = coordinated recovery after a larger disaster
```

Replication helps availability, but it may quickly replicate deletion, corruption, ransomware, or bad writes. Keep recovery copies with appropriate isolation and history.

# 16.9.8 Define RTO and RPO per journey

```text
RTO: maximum acceptable time from disruptive event to restored journey
RPO: maximum acceptable lost history measured backward from the event
```

Different data needs different objectives:

| Capability | Example RTO | Example RPO | Reason |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Checkout writes | 60 min | 5 min | revenue and order integrity |
| Analytics dashboard | 8 h | 24 h | delayed insight acceptable |
| Public documentation | 4 h | 24 h | rebuildable/static |

These are examples, not universal targets. Business, legal, safety, dependency, and cost owners approve them.

# 16.9.9 Backup design dimensions

Specify:

```text
what data/config/metadata/keys is backed up
frequency and consistency point
full/incremental/log-based method
retention and version history
encryption and key recovery
access separation and immutability
cross-account/region/provider copy where required
integrity verification
restore owner, tooling, and tested time
deletion/legal-hold policy
```

An encrypted backup whose key is lost in the same disaster is not recoverable.

# 16.9.10 Application-consistent recovery

A distributed application may need a coordinated point across database, object store, queue, and configuration. Independent snapshots taken at different times can restore an impossible business state.

Define reconciliation:

```text
accepted API request but message missing
message processed but database restore is older
object exists but metadata row missing
payment authorized but order status unknown
```

Use transaction/outbox/idempotency/audit patterns appropriate to the design and test business invariants after restore.

# 16.9.11 DR dependency inventory

Include dependencies often omitted from the main database plan:

```text
cloud account and quota
DNS/registrar and certificates
KMS/HSM/key administrators
identity and break-glass access
Git repositories and CI runners
artifact/container registries
IaC state and provider access
secret manager
network/IP/address capacity
observability and paging
external providers and contracts
people/contact information
```

For each, record regional scope, recovery method, owner, and test evidence.

# 16.9.12 Active-active, active-passive, and restore-only

| Strategy | Benefit | Major challenge |
|---|---|---|
| Active-active | Fast continuity and capacity utilization | data consistency, routing, shared failure, cost |
| Active-passive warm | Faster failover with simpler writes | drift, idle cost, capacity validation |
| Pilot light | Core data/services ready | provisioning and integration recovery time |
| Backup/restore | Lower ongoing cost | longer RTO and more steps/uncertainty |

Choose from objectives and tested complexity. Active-active can increase incident risk if conflicting writes and failback are not controlled.

# 16.9.13 Fencing and split brain

Before promoting a new writer/controller, ensure the old one cannot continue making conflicting changes:

```text
lease/quorum or authoritative promotion
network/identity fencing
write token/epoch
DNS alone is not immediate fencing
audited declaration authority
integrity checks before and after promotion
```

Never create two writable primaries merely to meet an RTO stopwatch.

# 16.9.14 Real hands-on: restore test

Use synthetic todo data with known counts and checksums:

1. Create backup and record recovery point.
2. Delete or corrupt the disposable primary dataset.
3. Restore into an isolated target with recovered configuration/keys.
4. Validate schema, row/object counts, checksums, relationships, and sample journeys.
5. Reconcile messages/side effects.
6. Measure detection, decision, restore, validation, and total RTO.
7. Calculate actual RPO from the newest recovered authoritative event.
8. Destroy the isolated lab safely after retaining the report.

Do not expose real sensitive production data in a less protected restore environment.

# 16.9.15 Real hands-on: Kubernetes zone-loss game day

Define steady state and abort conditions, then in a safe cluster make one zone unavailable or cordon/drain equivalent capacity. Observe:

```text
topology placement and pending pods
PodDisruptionBudget behavior
node autoscaling/quota/IP capacity
stateful volume zone constraints
traffic/readiness and connection draining
SLO, queue, and retry amplification
alert and on-call workflow
recovery and rebalance
```

PDBs govern certain voluntary evictions; they do not guarantee capacity or protect every failure.

# 16.9.16 Regional DR game-day phases

```text
DECLARE
  authority confirms scenario and freezes conflicting changes
FENCE
  prevent old-region writes/control loops
RESTORE/PROMOTE
  infrastructure, identity, config, secrets, data, applications
ROUTE
  shift traffic with cache/TTL awareness
VALIDATE
  integrity, critical user journeys, telemetry, security
OPERATE DEGRADED
  capacity, backlog, support, communication
FAILBACK
  reconcile data, reverse safely, revalidate
```

Failback is a second risky migration and deserves its own plan.

# 16.9.17 Chaos/resilience experiment maturity

Progress deliberately:

```text
architecture review/tabletop
component test in development
integrated staging fault
controlled production experiment with tiny blast radius
regular automated resilience check where safe
```

Every experiment needs owner, approval, hypothesis, steady-state SLI, scope, abort, monitoring, recovery, and learning. Chaos is not random destruction.

# 16.9.18 Backup security

Backups are high-value data assets. Apply least-privilege write/read/delete roles, separate administrators, immutability/versioning where required, encryption with recoverable keys, access logging, private networking, malware/corruption scanning, and retention/legal controls.

Test compromised-primary scenarios: can a stolen production identity delete every recovery copy?

# 16.9.19 Recovery validation checklist

- RTO/RPO are journey/data specific and approved.
- Backup scope includes config, metadata, identity, and keys.
- Restore is tested in isolation with real tooling.
- Business invariants and side effects are reconciled.
- Fencing prevents competing writers/controllers.
- Dependencies and quotas are included.
- DNS/routing propagation is measured.
- Observability/page path works in recovery environment.
- Actual RTO/RPO and manual steps are recorded.
- Failback and degraded operation are practiced.
- Backup access and deletion are protected/audited.

# 16.9.20 Certification and interview preparation

HA, backup, RTO/RPO, and DR are common cloud/Kubernetes/SRE competencies. Verify exact current service and exam behavior separately.

**Beginner: Backup versus restore?**  A backup is recovery material; restore is the tested process that creates a usable, validated system.

**Beginner: HA versus DR?**  HA continues through defined smaller failures; DR restores after a larger site/control/data loss.

**Intermediate: RTO versus RPO?**  RTO is acceptable recovery duration; RPO is acceptable data loss measured in time.

**Intermediate: Why is replication not a backup?**  It can rapidly copy corruption/deletion and may share access/failure domains.

**Senior: What is split brain?**  More than one writer/controller acts as authoritative, risking conflicting state; use fencing/quorum/epochs and controlled promotion.

**Senior: How do you prove a backup?**  Restore it in isolation, validate integrity/business journeys, calculate actual RPO/RTO, and retain evidence.

**Expert: What is commonly forgotten in regional DR?**  Identity, keys, DNS/certificates, Git/registry/IaC state, quotas, observability, external providers, reconciliation, and failback.

**Architect: How do you choose active-active versus restore-only?**  Balance approved RTO/RPO and business impact against consistency, operational complexity, correlated failure, capacity, cost, and test evidence.

**Never-forget answer:** recovery is a measured user outcome. Protect independent copies, fence authority, restore the entire dependency chain, validate integrity, and rehearse failback.

# 16.9.21 Professional Mastery Workbook

This workbook expands **Resilience Testing, Backup and Disaster Recovery** into deliberate practice without replacing the authored tutorial above.

Use it after reading the core explanation. The goal is not to memorize thousands of lines; the goal is to repeatedly explain, build, break, secure, observe, recover, and defend the lesson in different conditions.

## Workbook learning contract

- Concepts covered: 20 lesson-specific anchors.
- Progression: beginner, intermediate, expert, professional, industry-ready, certification review, and interview defense.
- Safety: use synthetic data, disposable resources, explicit placeholders, least privilege, and bounded failure experiments.
- Completion: retain commands or configuration, observations, screenshots or query output, decisions, rollback evidence, and a short reflection.
- Quality rule: a passing answer states assumptions, protects a user or business outcome, names ownership, and validates the final result end to end.
- Currency rule: verify current official documentation, versions, limits, pricing, and certification objectives before relying on changing product behavior.

## Seven-stage progression

| Stage | Learner must demonstrate |
|---|---|
| Beginner | Explain the concept in plain language and give one safe example. |
| Intermediate | Connect components, data, control flow, and normal operating behavior. |
| Expert | Analyze trade-offs, edge cases, scaling pressure, and correlated failures. |
| Professional | Make a reviewed decision with owner, evidence, rollout, and rollback. |
| Industry-ready | Operate the design under security, failure, recovery, cost, and compliance constraints. |
| Certification review | Map durable concepts to the latest official objectives without relying on stale wording. |
| Interview defense | Answer concisely, clarify assumptions, draw the model, and defend alternatives. |
